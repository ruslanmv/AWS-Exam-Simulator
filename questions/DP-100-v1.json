Mod els will use global and local market data to meet the follow ing business goals: Understand sentiment of mobile device users at spor ting events based on audio from crowd reactions. Assess a user's tendency to respond to an advertise ment. Customize styles of ads served on mobile devices. Use video to detect penalty events Current environment Media used for penalty event detection will be prov ided by consumer devices. Media may include images and videos captured during the sporting event and s hared using social media. The images and videos wil l have varying sizes and formats. The data available for model building comprises of seven years of sporting event media. The sporting e vent media includes; recorded video transcripts or radio commentary, and logs from related social media fee ds captured during the sporting events. Crowd sentiment will include audio recordings submi tted by event attendees in both mono and stereo formats. Penalty detection and sentiment Data scientists must build an intelligent solution by using multiple machine learning models for penal ty event detection. Data scientists must build notebooks in a local env ironment using automatic feature engineering and mo del building in machine learning pipelines. Notebooks must be deployed to retrain by using Spar k instances with dynamic worker allocation. Notebooks must execute with the same code on new Sp ark instances to recode only the source of the data . Global penalty detection models must be trained by using dynamic runtime graph computation during training. Local penalty detection models must be written by u sing BrainScript. Experiments for local crowd sentiment models must c ombine local penalty detection data. Crowd sentiment models must identify known sounds s uch as cheers and known catch phrases. Individual crowd sentiment models will detect similar sounds. All shared features for local models are continuous variables. Shared features must use double precision. Subseque nt layers must have aggregate running mean and standard deviation metrics available. Advertisements During the initial weeks in production, the followi ng was observed: Ad response rated declined. Drops were not consistent across ad styles. The distribution of features across training and pr oduction data are not consistent Analysis shows that, of the 100 numeric features on user location and behavior, the 47 features that c ome from location sources are being used as raw features. A suggested experiment to remedy the bias and varianc e issue is to engineer 10 linearly uncorrelated featu res. Initial data discovery shows a wide range of densit ies of target states in training data used for crow d sentiment models. All penalty detection models show inference phases using a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) are runni ng D283ABFBEDB32CDCE3B3406B9C29DB2F too slow. Audio samples show that the length of a catch phras e varies between 25%-47% depending on region The performance of the global penalty detection mod els shows lower variance but higher bias when comparing training and validation sets. Before impl ementing any feature changes, you must confirm the bias and variance using all training and validation case s. Ad response models must be trained at the beginning of each event and applied during the sporting even t. Market segmentation models must optimize for simila r ad response history. Sampling must guarantee mutual and collective exclu sively between local and global segmentation models that share the same features. Local market segmentation models will be applied be fore determining a user's propensity to respond to an advertisement. Ad response models must support non-linear boundari es of features.

Overview You are a data scientist for Fabrikam Residences, a  company specializing in quality private and commer cial property in the United States. Fabrikam Residences is considering expanding into Europe and has asked you to investigate prices for private residences in major European cities. You use Azure Machine Learning Stu dio to measure the median value of properties. You produce  a regression model to predict property prices by u sing the Linear Regression and Bayesian Linear Regressio n modules. Datasets There are two datasets in CSV format that contain p roperty details for two cities, London and Paris. Y ou add both files to Azure Machine Learning Studio as sepa rate datasets to the starting point for an experime nt. Both datasets contain the following columns: D283ABFBEDB32CDCE3B3406B9C29DB2F An initial investigation shows that the datasets ar e identical in structure apart from the MedianValue  column. The smaller Paris dataset contains the MedianValue in text format, whereas the larger London dataset c ontains the MedianValue in numerical format. Data issues Missing values The AccessibilityToHighway column in both datasets contains missing values. The missing data must be replaced with new data so that it is modeled condit ionally using the other variables in the data befor e filling in the missing values. Columns in each dataset contain missing and null va lues. The datasets also contain many outliers. The Age column has a high proportion of outliers. You need to remove the rows that have outliers in the Age co lumn. The MedianValue and AvgRoomsInHouse columns both ho ld data in numeric format. You need to select a feature selection algorithm to analyze the relation ship between the two columns in more detail. Model fit The model shows signs of overfitting. You need to p roduce a more refined regression model that reduces  the overfitting. Experiment requirements You must set up the experiment to cross-validate th e Linear Regression and Bayesian Linear Regression modules to evaluate performance. In each case, the predictor of the dataset is the column named MedianValue. You must ensure that the datatype of t he MedianValue column of the Paris dataset matches the structure of the London dataset. You must prioritize the columns of data for predict ing the outcome. You must use non-parametric statis tics to measure relationships. You must use a feature selection algorithm to analy ze the relationship between the MedianValue and AvgRoomsInHouse columns. Model training Permutation Feature Importance D283ABFBEDB32CDCE3B3406B9C29DB2F Given a trained model and a test dataset, you must compute the Permutation Feature Importance scores o f feature variables. You must be determined the absol ute fit for the model. Hyperparameters You must configure hyperparameters in the model lea rning process to speed the learning phase. In addit ion, this configuration should cancel the lowest perform ing runs at each evaluation interval, thereby direc ting effort and resources towards models that are more likely t o be successful. You are concerned that the model might not efficien tly use compute resources in hyperparameter tuning.  You also are concerned that the model might prevent an increase in the overall tuning time. Therefore, mus t implement an early stopping criterion on models tha t provides savings without terminating promising jo bs. Testing You must produce multiple partitions of a dataset b ased on sampling using the Partition and Sample mod ule in Azure Machine Learning Studio. Cross-validation You must create three equal partitions for cross-va lidation. You must also configure the cross-validat ion process so that the rows in the test and training d atasets are divided evenly by properties that are n ear each city's main river. You must complete this task befo re the data goes through the sampling process. Linear regression module When you train a Linear Regression module, you must  determine the best features to use in a model. You  can choose standard metrics provided to measure perform ance before and after the feature importance proces s completes. The distribution of features across mult iple training models must be consistent. Data visualization You need to provide the test results to the Fabrika m Residences team. You create data visualizations t o aid in presenting the results. You must produce a Receiver Operating Characteristi c (ROC) curve to conduct a diagnostic test evaluati on of the model. You need to select appropriate methods f or producing the ROC curve in Azure Machine Learnin g Studio to compare the Two-Class Decision Forest and  the Two-Class Decision Jungle modules with one another.",

Overview You are a data scientist for Fabrikam Residences, a company specializing in quality private and commer cial property in the United States. Fabrikam Residences is considering expanding into Europe and has asked you to investigate prices for private residences in major European cities. You use Azure Machine Learning Stu dio to measure the median value of properties. You produce a regression model to predict property prices by u sing the Linear Regression and Bayesian Linear Regressio n modules. Datasets There are two datasets in CSV format that contain p roperty details for two cities, London and Paris. Y ou add both files to Azure Machine Learning Studio as sepa rate datasets to the starting point for an experime nt. Both datasets contain the following columns: D283ABFBEDB32CDCE3B3406B9C29DB2F An initial investigation shows that the datasets ar e identical in structure apart from the MedianValue column. The smaller Paris dataset contains the MedianValue in text format, whereas the larger London dataset c ontains the MedianValue in numerical format. Data issues Missing values The AccessibilityToHighway column in both datasets contains missing values. The missing data must be replaced with new data so that it is modeled condit ionally using the other variables in the data befor e filling in the missing values. Columns in each dataset contain missing and null va lues. The datasets also contain many outliers. The Age column has a high proportion of outliers. You need to remove the rows that have outliers in the Age co lumn. The MedianValue and AvgRoomsInHouse columns both ho ld data in numeric format. You need to select a feature selection algorithm to analyze the relation ship between the two columns in more detail. Model fit The model shows signs of overfitting. You need to p roduce a more refined regression model that reduces the overfitting. Experiment requirements You must set up the experiment to cross-validate th e Linear Regression and Bayesian Linear Regression modules to evaluate performance. In each case, the predictor of the dataset is the column named MedianValue. You must ensure that the datatype of t he MedianValue column of the Paris dataset matches the structure of the London dataset. You must prioritize the columns of data for predict ing the outcome. You must use non-parametric statis tics to measure relationships. You must use a feature selection algorithm to analy ze the relationship between the MedianValue and AvgRoomsInHouse columns. Model training Permutation Feature Importance D283ABFBEDB32CDCE3B3406B9C29DB2F Given a trained model and a test dataset, you must compute the Permutation Feature Importance scores o f feature variables. You must be determined the absol ute fit for the model. Hyperparameters You must configure hyperparameters in the model lea rning process to speed the learning phase. In addit ion, this configuration should cancel the lowest perform ing runs at each evaluation interval, thereby direc ting effort and resources towards models that are more likely t o be successful. You are concerned that the model might not efficien tly use compute resources in hyperparameter tuning. You also are concerned that the model might prevent an increase in the overall tuning time. Therefore, mus t implement an early stopping criterion on models tha t provides savings without terminating promising jo bs. Testing You must produce multiple partitions of a dataset b ased on sampling using the Partition and Sample mod ule in Azure Machine Learning Studio. Cross-validation You must create three equal partitions for cross-va lidation. You must also configure the cross-validat ion process so that the rows in the test and training d atasets are divided evenly by properties that are n ear each city's main river. You must complete this task befo re the data goes through the sampling process. Linear regression module When you train a Linear Regression module, you must determine the best features to use in a model. You can choose standard metrics provided to measure perform ance before and after the feature importance proces s completes. The distribution of features across mult iple training models must be consistent. Data visualization You need to provide the test results to the Fabrika m Residences team. You create data visualizations t o aid in presenting the results. You must produce a Receiver Operating Characteristi c (ROC) curve to conduct a diagnostic test evaluati on of the model. You need to select appropriate methods f or producing the ROC curve in Azure Machine Learnin g Studio to compare the Two-Class Decision Forest and the Two-Class Decision Jungle modules with one another."
