On e of the developers was instructed to create the environment variables for the MongoDB database host name, username, and password as well as the API credentials that will be used by the Lambda functio n for DEV, SIT, UAT, and PROD environments.

        ],
        "correct": "D. D. Create a new KMS key and use it to enable encr yption helpers that leverage on AWS Key",
        "explanation": "Explanation When you create or update Lambda functions that use  environment variables, AWS Lambda encrypts them using the AWS Key Management Service. When your Lam bda function is invoked, those values are decrypted and made available to the Lambda code. The first time you create or update Lambda function s that use environment variables in a region, a def ault service key is created for you automatically within  AWS KMS. This key is used to encrypt environment variables. However, if you wish to use encryption h elpers and use KMS to encrypt environment variables after your Lambda function is created, you must cre ate your own AWS KMS key and choose it instead of the default key. The default key will give errors w hen chosen. Creating your own key gives you more flexibility, including the ability to create, rotat e, disable, and define access controls, and to audi t the encryption keys used to protect your data. The option that says: There is no need to do anythi ng because, by default, AWS Lambda already encrypts the environment variables using the AWS Ke y Management Service is incorrect. Although Lambda encrypts the environment variables in your f unction by default, the sensitive information would still be visible to other users who have access to the Lambda console. This is because Lambda uses a default KMS key to encrypt the variables, which is usually accessible by other users. The best option in this scenario is to use encryption helpers to secure you r environment variables. The option that says: Enable SSL encryption that le verages on AWS CloudHSM to store and encrypt the sensitive information is also incorrect since e nabling SSL would encrypt data only when in-transit . Your other teams would still be able to view the pl aintext at-rest. Use AWS KMS instead. The option that says: AWS Lambda does not provide e ncryption for the environment variables. Deploy your code to an EC2 instance instead is inco rrect since, as mentioned, Lambda does provide encryption functionality of environment variables.

        "question": ": A company hosted an e-commerce website on an Auto S caling group of EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The Solutions Architect noticed that the website is receiving a large numbe r of illegitimate external requests from multiple system s with IP addresses that constantly change. To reso lve the performance issues, the Solutions Architect mus t implement a solution that would block the illegit imate requests with minimal impact on legitimate traffic. Which of the following options fulfills this requir ement?",

            "A. A. Create a regular rule in AWS WAF and associate  the web ACL to an Application Load",

        ],
        "correct": "B. B. Create a rate-based rule in AWS WAF and associ ate the web ACL to an Application Load",
        "explanation": "Explanation AWS WAF is tightly integrated with Amazon CloudFron t, the Application Load Balancer (ALB), Amazon API Gateway, and AWS AppSync  services that AWS cus tomers commonly use to deliver content for their websites and applications. When you use AWS W AF on Amazon CloudFront, your rules run in all AWS Edge Locations, located around the world close to your end-users. This means security doesn't come at the expense of performance. Blocked requests are  stopped before they reach your web servers. When y ou use AWS WAF on regional services, such as Applicati on Load Balancer, Amazon API Gateway, and AWS AppSync, your rules run in the region and can be us ed to protect Internet-facing resources as well as internal resources. certkingdom.cm A rate-based rule tracks the rate of requests for e ach originating IP address and triggers the rule ac tion on IPs with rates that go over a limit. You set the li mit as the number of requests per 5-minute time spa n. You can use this type of rule to put a temporary block on requests from an IP address that's sending exces sive requests. Based on the given scenario, the requirement is to limit the number of requests from the illegitimate requests without affecting the genuine requests. To  accomplish this requirement, you can use AWS WAF web ACL. There are two types of rules in creating y our own web ACL rule: regular and rate-based rules. You need to select the latter to add a rate limit to your web ACL. After c reating the web ACL, you can associate it with ALB. When the rule action triggers, AWS WAF applies the action to additional requests from the IP address u ntil the request rate falls below the limit. Hence, the correct answer is: Create a rate-based r ule in AWS WAF and associate the web ACL to an Application Load Balancer. The option that says: Create a regular rule in AWS WAF and associate the web ACL to an Application Load Balancer is incorrect because a re gular rule only matches the statement defined in th e rule. If you need to add a rate limit to your rule,  you should create a rate-based rule. The option that says: Create a custom network ACL a nd associate it with the subnet of the Application Load Balancer to block the offending requests is in correct. Although NACLs can help you block incoming traffic, this option wouldn't be able to l imit the number of requests from a single IP addres s that is dynamically changing. The option that says: Create a custom rule in the s ecurity group of the Application Load Balancer to block the offending requests is incorrect because t he security group can only allow incoming traffic. Remember that you can't deny traffic using security  groups. In addition, it is not capable of limiting  the rate of traffic to your application unlike AWS WAF.

        "correct": "",
        "explanation": "Explanation By using Versioning and enabling MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) Delete, you can secure and recover your S3 objects from accidental deletion or overwri te. Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. Versioning-enabled buckets enable you to recover objects from accident al deletion or overwrite. You can use versioning to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of ev ery object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. With versioning, you can easily recover from both uninte nded user actions and application failures. You can also optionally add another layer of securi ty by configuring a bucket to enable MFA (Multi-Fac tor Authentication) Delete, which requires additional a uthentication for either of the following operation s: - Change the versioning state of your bucket - Permanently delete an object version MFA Delete requires two forms of authentication tog ether: - Your security credentials - The concatenation of a valid serial number, a spa ce, and the six-digit code displayed on an approved authentication device Providing access to S3 data strictly through pre-si gned URL only is incorrect since a pre-signed URL gives access to the object identified in the URL. P re-signed URLs are useful when customers perform an object upload to your S3 bucket, but does not help in preventing accidental deletes. Disallowing S3 Delete using an IAM bucket policy is  incorrect since you still want users to be able to delete objects in the bucket, and you just want to prevent accidental deletions. Disallowing S3 Delete  using an IAM bucket policy will restrict all delete opera tions to your bucket. Enabling Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering is incorrect  since S3 intelligent tiering does not help in this situation.",

        "explanation": "Explanation Considering that the company is using a corporate A ctive Directory, it is best to use AWS Directory Service AD Connector for easier integration. In add ition, since the roles are already assigned using g roups in the corporate Active Directory, it would be bett er to also use IAM Roles. Take note that you can as sign an IAM Role to the users or groups from your Active  Directory once it is integrated with your VPC via the AWS Directory Service AD Connector. AWS Directory Service provides multiple ways to use  Amazon Cloud Directory and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) with other AWS services. Directories  store information about users, groups, and devices , and administrators use them to manage access to inf ormation and resources. AWS Directory Service provides multiple directory choices for customers w ho want to use existing Microsoft AD or Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)aware applications in the cloud. It also offers those same choices to developers who need a directory to manage users, gr oups, devices, and access. AWS Directory Service Simple AD is incorrect becaus e this just provides a subset of the features offer ed by AWS Managed Microsoft AD, including the ability to manage user accounts and group memberships, create and apply group policies, securely connect t o Amazon EC2 instances, and provide Kerberos-based single sign-on (SSO). In this scenario, the more su itable component to use is the AD Connector since i t is a directory gateway with which you can redirect direc tory requests to your on-premises Microsoft Active Directory. IAM Groups is incorrect because this is just a coll ection of IAM users. Groups let you specify permiss ions for multiple users, which can make it easier to manage the permissions for those users.

        ],
        "correct": "D. D. Use Amazon FSx For Lustre and Amazon S3 for ho t and cold storage respectively.",
        "explanation": "Explanation Hot storage refers to the storage that keeps freque ntly accessed data (hot data). Warm storage refers to the storage that keeps less frequently accessed data (w arm data). Cold storage refers to the storage that keeps rarely accessed data (cold data). In terms of prici ng, the colder the data, the cheaper it is to store , and the costlier it is to access when needed. Amazon FSx For Lustre is a high-performance file sy stem for fast processing of workloads. Lustre is a popular open-source parallel file system which stor es data across multiple network file servers to maximize performance and reduce bottlenecks. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is a fully manag ed Microsoft Windows file system with full support for the SMB protocol, Windows NTFS, Microso ft Active Directory (AD) Integration. Amazon Elastic File System is a fully-managed file storage service that makes it easy to set up and sc ale file storage in the Amazon Cloud. Amazon S3 is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, se curity, and performance. S3 offers different storage tiers for different use cases (frequently accessed data, infrequently accessed data, and rarely accessed dat a). The question has two requirements: High-performance, parallel hot storage to process t he training datasets concurrently. Cost-effective cold storage to keep the archived da tasets that are accessed infrequently In this case, we can use Amazon FSx For Lustre for the first requirement, as it provides a high- performance, parallel file system for hot data. On the second requirement, we can use Amazon S3 for storing cold data. Amazon S3 supports a cold storag e system via Amazon S3 Glacier / Glacier Deep Archive. Hence, the correct answer is: Use Amazon FSx For Lu stre and Amazon S3 for hot and cold storage respectively. Using Amazon FSx For Lustre and Amazon EBS Provisio ned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes for hot and cold storage respectively is incorrect because the Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes are designed for storing hot data (data that are frequently accessed ) used in I/O-intensive workloads. EBS has a storag e option called \"Cold HDD,\" but due to its price, it is not ideal for data archiving. EBS Cold HDD is mu ch more expensive than Amazon S3 Glacier / Glacier Dee p Archive and is often utilized in applications whe re sequential cold data is read less frequently. Using Amazon Elastic File System and Amazon S3 for hot and cold storage respectively is incorrect. Although EFS supports concurrent access to data, it  does not have the high-performance ability that is required for machine learning workloads. Using Amazon FSx For Windows File Server and Amazon  S3 for hot and cold storage respectively is incorrect because Amazon FSx For Windows File Serve r does not have a parallel file system, unlike Lust re.

        "correct": "",
        "explanation": "Explanation You manage access in AWS by creating policies and a ttaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an o bject in AWS that, when associated with an identity  or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role)  makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine wh ether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. AWS s upports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boun daries, AWS Organizations SCPs, ACLs, and session policies. IAM policies define permissions for action regardle ss of the method that you use to perform the operat ion. For example, if a policy allows the GetUser action, the n a user with that policy can get user information from the AWS Management Console, the AWS CLI, or the AWS API . When you create an IAM user, you can choose to allow console or programmatic access.  If console access is allowed, the IAM user can sig n in to the console using a user name and password. Or if p rogrammatic access is allowed, the user can use access keys to work with the CLI or API. Based on the provided IAM policy, the user is only allowed to get, write, and list all of the objects for the boracay s3 bucket. The s3:PutObject basically means  that you can submit a PUT object request to the S3 bucket to store data. Hence, the correct answers are: - An IAM user with this IAM policy is allowed to re ad objects from all S3 buckets owned by the account. - An IAM user with this IAM policy is allowed to wr ite objects into the boracay S3 bucket. - An IAM user with this IAM policy is allowed to re ad objects from the boracay S3 bucket. The option that says: An IAM user with this IAM pol icy is allowed to change access rights for the boracay S3 bucket is incorrect because the template  does not have any statements which allow the user to change access rights in the bucket. The option that says: An IAM user with this IAM pol icy is allowed to read objects in the boracay S3 bucket but not allowed to list the objects in the b ucket is incorrect because it can clearly be seen i n the template that there is a s3:List* which permits the user to list objects. The option that says: An IAM user with this IAM pol icy is allowed to read and delete objects from the boracay S3 bucket is incorrect. Although you can re ad objects from the bucket, you cannot delete any objects.

        "correct": "B. B. Launch an Amazon Aurora Serverless DB cluster then set the minimum and maximum",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Aurora Serverless is an on-demand, auto-scal ing configuration for Amazon Aurora. An Aurora Serverless DB cluster is a DB cluster that automati cally starts up, shuts down, and scales up or down its compute capacity based on your application's needs.  Aurora Serverless provides a relatively simple, co st- effective option for infrequent, intermittent, spor adic or unpredictable workloads. It can provide thi s because it automatically starts up, scales compute capacity to  match your application's usage and shuts down when  it's not in use. Take note that a non-Serverless DB cluster for Auro ra is called a provisioned DB cluster. Aurora Serve rless clusters and provisioned clusters both have the sam e kind of high-capacity, distributed, and highly av ailable storage volume. When you work with Amazon Aurora without Aurora Ser verless (provisioned DB clusters), you can choose your DB instance class size and create Aurora Repli cas to increase read throughput. If your workload changes, you can modify the DB instance class size and change the number of Aurora Replicas. This mode l works well when the database workload is predictabl e, because you can adjust capacity manually based o n the expected workload. However, in some environments, workloads can be int ermittent and unpredictable. There can be periods o f heavy workloads that might last only a few minutes or hours, and also long periods of light activity, or even no activity. Some examples are retail websites with in termittent sales events, reporting databases that p roduce reports when needed, development and testing enviro nments, and new applications with uncertain requirements. In these cases and many others, it ca n be difficult to configure the correct capacity at  the right times. It can also result in higher costs when you pay for capacity that isn't used. certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom With Aurora Serverless , you can create a database endpoint without specifying the DB instance class s ize. You set the minimum and maximum capacity. With Auro ra Serverless, the database endpoint connects to a proxy fleet that routes the workload to a fleet of resources that are automatically scaled. Because of  the proxy fleet, connections are continuous as Aurora Serverless sca les the resources automatically based on the minimu m and maximum capacity specifications. Database clien t applications don't need to change to use the prox y fleet. Aurora Serverless manages the connections automatic ally. Scaling is rapid because it uses a pool of \"w arm\" resources that are always ready to service requests . Storage and processing are separate, so you can s cale down to zero processing and pay only for storage. Aurora Serverless introduces a new serverless DB en gine mode for Aurora DB clusters. Non-Serverless DB clusters use the provisioned DB engine mode. Hence, the correct answer is: Launch an Amazon Auro ra Serverless DB cluster then set the minimum and maximum capacity for the cluster. The option that says: Launch an Amazon Aurora Provi sioned DB cluster with burstable performance DB instance class types is incorrect because an Aurora  Provisioned DB cluster is not suitable for intermi ttent, sporadic, and unpredictable transactional workloads . This model works well when the database workload is predictable because you can adjust capacity manuall y based on the expected workload. A better database setup here is to use an Amazon Aurora Serverless cl uster. The option that says: Launch a DynamoDB Global tabl e with Auto Scaling enabled is incorrect because certkingdom although it is using Auto Scaling, the scenario exp licitly indicated that you need a relational databa se to handle your transactional workloads. DynamoDB is a NoSQL database and is not suitable for this use cas e. certkingdom Moreover, the use of a DynamoDB Global table is not  warranted since this is primarily used if you need  a certkingdom fully managed, multi-region, and multi-master datab ase that provides fast, local, read and write certkingdom certkingdom performance for massively scaled, global applicatio ns. certkingdom certkingdom The option that says: Launch an Amazon Redshift dat a warehouse cluster with Concurrency Scaling is certkingdom incorrect because this type of database is primaril y used for online analytical processing (OLAP) and not certkingdom for online transactional processing (OLTP).

The functions run in response to CloudFront event s, without provisioning or managing servers. You can u se Lambda functions to change CloudFront requests and responses at the following points: - After CloudFront receives a request from a viewer  (viewer request) - Before CloudFront forwards the request to the ori gin (origin request) - After CloudFront receives the response from the o rigin (origin response) - Before CloudFront forwards the response to the vi ewer (viewer response) In the given scenario, you can use Lambda@Edge to a llow your Lambda functions to customize the content that CloudFront delivers and to execute the authent ication process in AWS locations closer to the user s. In addition, you can set up an origin failover by crea ting an origin group with two origins with one as t he primary origin and the other as the second origin w hich CloudFront automatically switches to when the primary origin fails. This will alleviate the occas ional HTTP 504 errors that users are experiencing.

Specify one as the primary origin and the other as the second origin which Clo udFront automatically switches to when the primary origin returns specific HTTP status code fa ilure responses. The option that says: Use multiple and geographical ly disperse VPCs to various AWS regions then create a transit VPC to connect all of your resourc es. In order to handle the requests faster, set up Lambda functions in each region using the AWS Serve rless Application Model (SAM) service is incorrect because of the same reason provided above . Although setting up multiple VPCs across various regions which are connected with a transit VPC is v alid, this solution still entails higher setup and maintenance costs. A more cost-effective option wou ld be to use Lambda@Edge instead. The option that says: Configure your origin to add a Cache-Control max-age directive to your objects, and specify the longest practical value for max-age  to increase the cache hit ratio of your CloudFront distribution is incorrect because improving the cac he hit ratio for the CloudFront distribution is irr elevant in this scenario. You can improve your cache perfor mance by increasing the proportion of your viewer requests that are served from CloudFront edge cache s instead of going to your origin servers for conte nt. However, take note that the problem in the scenario  is the sluggish authentication process of your glo bal users and not just the caching of the static object s. The option that says: Deploy your application to mu ltiple AWS regions to accommodate your users around the world. Set up a Route 53 record with lat ency routing policy to route incoming traffic to the region that provides the best latency to the us er is incorrect because although this may resolve t he performance issue, this solution entails a signific ant implementation cost since you have to deploy yo ur application to multiple AWS regions. Remember that the scenario asks for a solution that will improve the performance of the application with minimal cost.

        ],
        "correct": "B. B. Enable DynamoDB Stream and create an AWS Lambd a trigger, as well as the IAM role",
        "explanation": "Explanation A DynamoDB stream is an ordered flow of information  about changes to items in an Amazon DynamoDB table. When you enable a stream on a table, DynamoD B captures information about every modification to data items in the table. Whenever an application creates, updates, or delete s items in the table, DynamoDB Streams writes a str eam record with the primary key attribute(s) of the ite ms that were modified. A stream record contains information about a data modification to a single i tem in a DynamoDB table. You can configure the stre am so that the stream records capture additional informat ion, such as the \"before\" and \"after\" images of modified items. Amazon DynamoDB is integrated with AWS Lambda so th at you can create triggers--pieces of code that automatically respond to events in DynamoDB Streams . With triggers, you can build applications that re act to data modifications in DynamoDB tables. If you enable DynamoDB Streams on a table, you can associate the stream ARN with a Lambda function that you write. Immediately after an item in the ta ble is modified, a new record appears in the table' s stream. AWS Lambda polls the stream and invokes your Lambda  function synchronously when it detects new stream records. The Lambda function can perform any  actions you specify, such as sending a notificatio n or initiating a workflow. Hence, the correct answer in this scenario is the o ption that says: Enable DynamoDB Stream and create an AWS Lambda trigger, as well as the IAM role whic h contains all of the permissions that the Lambda function will need at runtime. The data from  the stream record will be processed by the Lambda function which will then publish a message t o SNS Topic that will notify the subscribers via email. The option that says: Using the Kinesis Client Libr ary (KCL), write an application that leverages on DynamoDB Streams Kinesis Adapter that will fetch da ta from the DynamoDB Streams endpoint. When there are updates made by a particular user, notify  the subscribers via email using SNS is incorrect because although this is a valid solution, it is mi ssing a vital step which is to enable DynamoDB Stre ams. With the DynamoDB Streams Kinesis Adapter in place,  you can begin developing applications via the KCL interface, with the API calls seamlessly direct ed at the DynamoDB Streams endpoint. Remember that the DynamoDB Stream feature is not enabled by defau lt. The option that says: Create a Lambda function that  uses DynamoDB Streams Kinesis Adapter which will fetch data from the DynamoDB Streams endpoint.  Set up an SNS Topic that will notify the subscribers via email when there is an update made by a particular user is incorrect because just like  in the above, you have to manually enable DynamoDB Streams  first before you can use its endpoint. The option that says: Set up a DAX cluster to acces s the source DynamoDB table. Create a new DynamoDB trigger and a Lambda function. For every u pdate made in the user data, the trigger will send data to the Lambda function which will then no tify the subscribers via email using SNS is incorrect because the DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) fe ature is primarily used to significantly improve th e in- memory read performance of your database, and not t o capture the time-ordered sequence of item-level modifications. You should use DynamoDB Streams in t his scenario instead.

        "correct": "B. B. Enable the IAM DB Authentication.",
        "explanation": "Explanation You can authenticate to your DB instance using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) database authentication. IAM database authentication works w ith MySQL and PostgreSQL. With this authentication method, you don't need to use a password when you c onnect to a DB instance. Instead, you use an authentication token. An authentication token is a unique string of chara cters that Amazon RDS generates on request. Authentication tokens are generated using AWS Signa ture Version 4. Each token has a lifetime of 15 minutes. You don't need to store user credentials i n the database, because authentication is managed externally using IAM. You can also still use standa rd database authentication. IAM database authentication provides the following benefits: Network traffic to and from the database is encrypt ed using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). You can use IAM to centrally manage access to your database resources, instead of managing access individually on each DB instance. For applications running on Amazon EC2, you can use  profile credentials specific to your EC2 instance to access your database instead of a password, for gre ater security Hence, enabling IAM DB Authentication is the correc t answer based on the above reference. Configuring SSL in your application to encrypt the database connection to RDS is incorrect because an SSL connection is not using an authentication to ken from IAM. Although configuring SSL to your application can improve the security of your data i n flight, it is still not a suitable option to use in this scenario. Creating an IAM Role and assigning it to your EC2 i nstances which will grant exclusive access to your RDS instance is incorrect because although you  can create and assign an IAM Role to your EC2 instances, you still need to configure your RDS to use IAM DB Authentication. Using a combination of IAM and STS to restrict acce ss to your RDS instance via a temporary token is incorrect because you have to use IAM DB Authent ication for this scenario, and not a combination of  an IAM and STS.

In this way, you can easily connect to AWS using the login credentials of your on-premises network. AWS supports identity federation with SAML 2.0, an open standard that many identity providers (IdPs) u se. This feature enables federated single sign-on (SSO) , so users can log into the AWS Management Console or call the AWS APIs without you having to create a n IAM user for everyone in your organization. By using SAML, you can simplify the process of configu ring federation with AWS, because you can use the IdP's service instead of writing custom identity pr oxy code. Before you can use SAML 2.0-based federation as des cribed in the preceding scenario and diagram, you must configure your organization's IdP and your AWS  account to trust each other. The general process f or configuring this trust is described in the followin g steps. Inside your organization, you must have an  IdP that supports SAML 2.0, like Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS, part of Windows Server), Shibboleth, or another compatible SAML 2.0  provider. Hence, the correct answer is: Set up SAML 2.0-Based  Federation by using a Microsoft Active Directory Federation Service (AD FS). Setting up SAML 2.0-Based Federation by using a Web  Identity Federation is incorrect because this is primarily used to let users sign in via a well-know n external identity provider (IdP), such as Login w ith Amazon, Facebook, Google. It does not utilize Active Direct ory. Using IAM users is incorrect because the situation requires you to use the existing credentials stored  in their Active Directory, and not user accounts that will b e generated by IAM. Using Amazon VPC is incorrect because this only let s you provision a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a v irtual network that you define.

As a result, you might find differences certkingdom between the measurements, because the hypervisor la yer performs a small amount of work. Hence, certkingdom certkingdom enabling Enhanced Monitoring in RDS is the correct answer in this specific scenario. certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom certkingdom The differences can be greater if your DB instances  use smaller instance classes, because then there a re likely more virtual machines (VMs) that are managed by the  hypervisor layer on a single physical instance. En hanced Monitoring metrics are useful when you want to see how different processes or threads on a DB instance  use the CPU. Using Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the CPU Utilizat ion of your database is incorrect because although you can use this to monitor the CPU Utiliz ation of your database instance, it does not provid e the percentage of the CPU bandwidth and total memory consumed by each  database process in your RDS instance. Take note that CloudWatch gathers metrics about CPU utilizati on from the hypervisor for a DB instance while RDS Enhanced Monitoring gathers its metrics from an age nt on the instance. The option that says: Create a script that collects  and publishes custom metrics to CloudWatch, which tracks the real-time CPU Utilization of the RDS ins tance and then set up a custom CloudWatch dashboard to view the metrics is incorrect because although you can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs and CloudWatch dashboard to monitor the CPU Utilization  of the database instance, using CloudWatch alone i s still not enough to get the specific percentage of the CP U bandwidth and total memory consumed by each database processes. The data provided by CloudWatch  is not as detailed as compared with the Enhanced Monitoring feature in RDS. Take note as well that y ou do not have direct access to the instances/serve rs of your RDS database instance, unlike with your EC2 in stances where you can install a CloudWatch agent or  a custom script to get CPU and memory utilization of your instance. The option that says: Check the CPU% and MEM% metri cs which are readily available in the Amazon RDS console that shows the percentage of the  CPU bandwidth and total memory consumed by each database process of your RDS instance is in correct because the CPU% and MEM% metrics are not readily available in the Amazon RDS console, wh ich is contrary to what is being stated in this opt ion.

Amazon FSx f or Windows File Server has the features, performanc e, and compatibility to easily lift and shift enterprise a pplications to the AWS Cloud. It is accessible from  Windows, Linux, and macOS compute instances and devices. Tho usands of compute instances and devices can access a file system concurrently. In this scenario, you need to migrate your existing  file share configuration to the cloud. Among the o ptions given, the best possible answer is Amazon FSx. A fi le share is a specific folder in your file system, including the folder's subfolders, which you make a ccessible to your compute instances via the SMB protocol. To migrate file share configurations from  your on-premises file system, you must migrate you r files first to Amazon FSx before migrating your file shar e configuration. Hence, the correct answer is: Migrate the existing file share configuration to Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. The option that says: Migrate the existing file sha re configuration to AWS Storage Gateway is incorrect because AWS Storage Gateway is primarily used to integrate your on-premises network to AWS but not for migrating your applications. Using a fi le share in Storage Gateway implies that you will s till keep your on-premises systems, and not entirely migrate it. The option that says: Migrate the existing file sha re configuration to Amazon EFS is incorrect because  it is stated in the scenario that the company is using a file share that runs on a Windows server.

It is built on Win dows Server, delivering a wide range of administrative f eatures such as user quotas, end-user file restore,  and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) integration. Amazon  FSx is accessible from Windows, Linux, and MacOS compute instances and devices. Thousands of c ompute instances and devices can access a file system concurrently. Amazon FSx works with Microsoft Active Directory to  integrate with your existing Microsoft Windows environments. You have two options to provide user authentication and access control for your file sys tem: AWS Managed Microsoft Active Directory and Self-man aged Microsoft Active Directory. Take note that after you create an Active Directory  configuration for a file system, you can't change that configuration. However, you can create a new file s ystem from a backup and change the Active Directory integration configuration for that file system. The se configurations allow the users in your domain to  use their existing identity to access the Amazon FSx file sys tem and to control access to individual files and f olders. Hence, the correct answer is: Create a file system using Amazon FSx for Windows File Server and join it to an Active Directory domain in AWS. The option that says: Create a file system using Am azon EFS and join it to an Active Directory domain is incorrect because Amazon EFS does not sup port Windows systems, only Linux OS. You should use Amazon FSx for Windows File Server instead to s atisfy the requirement in the scenario. The option that says: Launch an Amazon EC2 Windows Server to mount a new S3 bucket as a file volume is incorrect because you can't integrate Ama zon S3 with your existing Active Directory to provi de authentication and access control. The option that says: Create a Network File System (NFS) file share using AWS Storage Gateway is incorrect because NFS file share is mainly used for  Linux systems. Remember that the requirement in th e scenario is to use a Windows shared file storage.

You have the flexibility to chang e families, OS types, and tenancies while benefitin g from RI pricing when you use Convertible RIs. One import ant thing to remember here is that Reserved Instanc es are not physical instances, but rather a billing di scount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in  your account. The offering class of a Reserved Instance is either  Standard or Convertible. A Standard Reserved Instance provides a more significant discount than a Convertible Reserved Instance, but you can't exchange a Standard Reserved Instance unlike Conver tible Reserved Instances. You can modify Standard and Convertible Reserved Instances. Take note that in Convertible Reserved Instances, you are allowed to exchange another Convertible Reserved instance with  a different instance type and tenancy. The configuration of a Reserved Instance comprises a single instance type, platform, scope, and tenanc y over a term. If your computing needs change, you mi ght be able to modify or exchange your Reserved Instance. When your computing needs change, you can modify yo ur Standard or Convertible Reserved Instances and continue to take advantage of the billing benefit. You can modify the Availability Zone, scope, networ k platform, or instance size (within the same instance type) of  your Reserved Instance. You can also sell your unu sed instance for Standard RIs but not Convertible RIs o n the Reserved Instance Marketplace. Hence, the correct options are: - Unused Standard Reserved Instances can later be s old at the Reserved Instance Marketplace. - Convertible Reserved Instances allow you to exchang e for another convertible reserved instance of a different instance family. The option that says: Unused Convertible Reserved I nstances can later be sold at the Reserved Instance Marketplace is incorrect. This is not poss ible. Only Standard RIs can be sold at the Reserved  Instance Marketplace. The option that says: It can enable you to reserve capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones and multiple AWS Regions for any  duration is incorrect because you can reserve capacity to a specific AWS Region (regional Reserve d Instance) or specific Availability Zone (zonal Reserved Instance) only.

        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon ECS enables you to inject sensitive data int o your containers by storing your sensitive data in  either AWS Secrets Manager secrets or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store parameters and then referencing them in your container definition. This  feature is supported by tasks using both the EC2 a nd Fargate launch types. Secrets can be exposed to a container in the follow ing ways: - To inject sensitive data into your containers as environment variables, use the secrets container de finition parameter. - To reference sensitive information in the log con figuration of a container, use the secretOptions co ntainer definition parameter. Within your container definition, specify secrets w ith the name of the environment variable to set in the container and the full ARN of either the Secrets Ma nager secret or Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter containing the sensitive data to present to the container. The parameter that you reference can be from a different Region than the container using it , but must be from within the same account. Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: Use the AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store to keep the database credentials and then encrypt them  using AWS KMS. Create an IAM Role for your Amazon ECS task execution role (taskRoleArn) and re ference it with your task definition, which allows access to both KMS and the Parameter Store. Within your container definition, specify secrets with the name of the environment variable to set in  the container and the full ARN of the Systems Manager Parameter Store parameter containing the se nsitive data to present to the container. The option that says: In the ECS task definition fi le of the ECS Cluster, store the database credentia ls using Docker Secrets to centrally manage these sens itive data and securely transmit it to only those containers that need access to it. Secrets are encr ypted during transit and at rest. A given secret is only accessible to those services which have been g ranted explicit access to it via IAM Role, and only while those service tasks are running is incorrect.  Although you can use Docker Secrets to secure the sensitive database credentials, this feature is onl y applicable in Docker Swarm. In AWS, the recommend ed way to secure sensitive data is either through the use of Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store. The option that says: Store the database credential s in the ECS task definition file of the ECS Cluste r and encrypt it with KMS. Store the task definition JSON  file in a private S3 bucket and ensure that HTTPS is enabled on the bucket to encrypt the data in-flight. Create an IAM role to the ECS task definition script that allows access to the specifi c S3 bucket and then pass the --cli-input-json parameter when calling the ECS register-task-defini tion. Reference the task definition JSON file in the S3 bucket which contains the database credentia ls is incorrect. Although the solution may work, it  is not recommended to store sensitive credentials in S3. T his entails a lot of overhead and manual configuration steps which can be simplified by simp ly using the Secrets Manager or Systems Manager Parameter Store. The option that says: Use the AWS Secrets Manager t o store the database credentials and then encrypt them using AWS KMS. Create a resource-based  policy for your Amazon ECS task execution role (taskRoleArn) and reference it with your task definition which allows access to both KMS and AWS Secrets Manager. Within your container definiti on, specify secrets with the name of the environment variable to set in the container and th e full ARN of the Secrets Manager secret which contains the sensitive data, to present to the cont ainer is incorrect. Although the use of Secrets Man ager in securing sensitive data in ECS is valid, Amazon ECS  doesn't support resource-based policies. An example of a resource-based policy is the S3 bucket  policy. An ECS task assumes an execution role (IAM  role) to be able to call other AWS services like AWS Secr ets Manager on your behalf.

You create collections of EC2 instances, called Aut o Scaling groups. You can specify the minimum number of insta nces in each Auto Scaling group, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group nev er goes below this size. You can also specify the maximum number of instances in each Auto Scaling gr oup, and Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling ensures that your group never goes above this size. To achieve highly available and fault-tolerant arch itecture for your applications, you must deploy all  your instances in different Availability Zones. This wil l help you isolate your resources if an outage occu rs. Take note that to achieve fault tolerance, you need  to have redundant resources in place to avoid any system degradation in the event of a server fault o r an Availability Zone outage. Having a fault-toler ant architecture entails an extra cost in running addit ional resources than what is usually needed. This i s to ensure that the mission-critical workloads are processed. Since the scenario requires at least 2 instances to  handle regular traffic, you should have 2 instance s running all the time even if an AZ outage occurred. You can  use an Auto Scaling Group to automatically scale y our compute resources across two or more Availability Z ones. You have to specify the minimum capacity to 4 instances and the maximum capacity to 6 instances. If each AZ has 2 i nstances running, even if an AZ fails, your system will still run a minimum of 2 instances. Hence, the correct answer in this scenario is: Crea te an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and set t he minimum capacity to 4 and the maximum capacity to 6 . Deploy 2 instances in Availability Zone A and another 2 instances in Availability Zone B. The option that says: Create an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and set the minimum capacity to 2 and the maximum capacity to 6. Deploy 4 instances  in Availability Zone A is incorrect because the instances are only deployed in a single Availabilit y Zone. It cannot protect your applications and dat a from datacenter or AZ failures. The option that says: Create an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and set the minimum capacity to 2 and the maximum capacity to 6. Use 2 Availability  Zones and deploy 1 instance for each AZ is incorrect. It is required to have 2 instances runni ng all the time. If an AZ outage happened, ASG will  launch a new instance on the unaffected AZ. This provisionin g does not happen instantly, which means that for a  certain period of time, there will only be 1 running instan ce left. The option that says: Create an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and set the minimum capacity to 2 and the maximum capacity to 4. Deploy 2 instances  in Availability Zone A and 2 instances in Availability Zone B is incorrect. Although this ful fills the requirement of at least 2 EC2 instances a nd high availability, the maximum capacity setting is wrong . It should be set to 6 to properly handle the peak  load. If an AZ outage occurs and the system is at its peak load , the number of running instances in this setup wil l only be 4 instead of 6 and this will affect the performance o f your application.

The optimal usage of a table's provisioned throughp ut depends not only on the workload patterns of individual items, but also on the partition-key des ign. This doesn't mean that you must access all par tition key values to achieve an efficient throughput level, or  even that the percentage of accessed partition key  values must be high. It does mean that the more distinct p artition key values that your workload accesses, th e more those requests will be spread across the partitione d space. In general, you will use your provisioned throughput more efficiently as the rati o of partition key values accessed to the total num ber of partition key values increases. One example for this is the use of partition keys w ith high-cardinality attributes, which have a large  number of distinct values for each item. Reducing the number of partition keys in the Dynamo DB table is incorrect. Instead of doing this, you should actually add more to improve its performance  to distribute the I/O requests evenly and not avoi d \"hot\" partitions. Using partition keys with low-cardinality attribute s, which have a few number of distinct values for each item is incorrect because this is the exact op posite of the correct answer. Remember that the mor e distinct partition key values your workload accesse s, the more those requests will be spread across th e partitioned space. Conversely, the less distinct pa rtition key values, the less evenly spread it would  be across the partitioned space, which effectively slows the performance. The option that says: Avoid using a composite prima ry key, which is composed of a partition key and a sort key is incorrect because as mentioned, a compo site primary key will provide more partition for th e table and in turn, improves the performance. Hence, it sh ould be used and not avoided.

        ],
        "correct": "C. C. Launch a Nitro-based EC2 instance and attach a  Provisioned IOPS SSD EBS volume (io1)",
        "explanation": "Explanation/Reference: Explanation An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level stor age device that you can attach to your instances. After you attach a volume to an instance, you can u se it as you would use a physical hard drive. EBS volumes are flexible. The AWS Nitro System is the underlying platform for  the latest generation of EC2 instances that enable s AWS to innovate faster, further reduce the cost of the customers, and deliver added benefits like increase d security and new instance types. Amazon EBS is a persistent block storage volume. It  can persist independently from the life of an inst ance. Since the scenario requires you to have an EBS volu me with up to 64,000 IOPS, you have to launch a Nitro-based EC2 instance. Hence, the correct answer in this scenario is: Laun ch a Nitro-based EC2 instance and attach a Provisioned IOPS SSD EBS volume (io1) with 64,000 I OPS. The option that says: Directly attach multiple Inst ance Store volumes in an EC2 instance to deliver maximum IOPS performance is incorrect. Although an Instance Store is a block storage volume, it is not persistent and the data will be gone if the instanc e is restarted from the stopped state (note that th is is different from the OS-level reboot. In OS-level reboot, data still persists in the instance store). An instance store only provides temporary block-level storage for your ins tance. It means that the data in the instance store  can be lost if the underlying disk drive fails, if the ins tance stops, and if the instance terminates. The option that says: Launch an Amazon EFS file sys tem and mount it to a Nitro-based Amazon EC2 instance and set the performance mode to Max I/O is  incorrect. Although Amazon EFS can provide over 64,000 IOPS, this solution uses a file system and not a block storage volume which is what is ask ed in the scenario. The option that says: Launch an EC2 instance and at tach an io1 EBS volume with 64,000 IOPS is incorrect. In order to achieve the 64,000 IOPS for a provisioned IOPS SSD, you must provision a Nitro-  based EC2 instance. The maximum IOPS and throughput are g uaranteed only on Instances built on the Nitro System provisioned with more than 32,000 IOPS . Other instances guarantee up to 32,000 IOPS only.

        "correct": "B.",
        "explanation": "Explanation Every AWS resource is owned by an AWS account, and permissions to create or access a resource are governed by permissions policies. An account admini strator can attach permissions policies to IAM identities (that is, users, groups, and roles), and  some services (such as AWS Lambda) also support attaching permissions policies to resources. In DynamoDB, the primary resources are tables. Dyna moDB also supports additional resource types, indexes, and streams. However, you can create index es and streams only in the context of an existing DynamoDB table. These are referred to as subresourc es. These resources and subresources have unique Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) associated with them. For example, an AWS Account (123456789012) has a Dy namoDB table named Books in the US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1) region. The ARN of the Books table would be: arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:123456789012:table/Books A policy is an entity that, when attached to an ide ntity or resource, defines their permissions. By us ing an IAM policy and role to control access, it will gran t a Lambda function access to a DynamoDB table. It is stated in the scenario that a Lambda function  will be used to modify the DynamoDB table named tutorialsdojo. Since you only need to access one ta ble, you will need to indicate that table in the re source element of the IAM policy. Also, you must specify t he effect and action elements that will be generate d in the policy. Hence, the correct answer in this scenario is: { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"TutorialsdojoTablePolicy\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"dynamodb:PutItem\", \"dynamodb:DeleteItem\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:12061898120 6:table/tutorialsdojo\" } ] } The IAM policy below is incorrect because the scena rio only requires you to allow the permissions in t he tutorialsdojo table. Having a wildcard: table/* in this policy would allow the Lambda function to modi fy all the DynamoDB tables in your account. { { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"TutorialsdojoTablePolicy\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"dynamodb:PutItem\", \"dynamodb:DeleteItem\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:12061898120 6:table/*\" } ]} The IAM policy below is incorrect. The first statem ent is correctly allowing PUT and DELETE actions to  the tutorialsdojo DynamoDB table. However, the second s tatement counteracts the first one as it allows all DynamoDB actions in the tutorialsdojo table. { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"TutorialsdojoTablePolicy1\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"dynamodb:PutItem\", \"dynamodb:DeleteIte m\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:12061898120 61898:table/tutorialsdojo\" }, { \"Sid\": \"TutorialsdojoTablePolicy2\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"dynamodb:*\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:12061898120 61898:table/tutorialsdojo\" } ] } The IAM policy below is incorrect. Just like the pr evious option, the first statement of this policy i s correctly allowing PUT and DELETE actions to the tutorialsdoj o DynamoDB table.

Therefore, this policy will not  allow any actions on all DynamoDB tables of the AWS account. { \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Sid\": \"TutorialsdojoTablePolicy1\", \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [ \"dynamodb:PutItem\", \"dynamodb:DeleteItem\" ], \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:12061898120 61898:table/tutorialsdojo\" }, { \"Sid\": \"TutorialsdojoTablePolicy2\", \"Effect\": \"Deny\", \"Action\": \"dynamodb:*\", \"Resource\": \"arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:12061898120 61898:table/*\" } ] } References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/d eveloperguide/using-identity-based-policies.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/re ference_policies_examples_lambda-access- dynamodb.html https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-create -an-aws-iam-policy-to-grant-aws-lambda-access-to- an-amazon-dynamodb-table/ Check out this AWS IAM Cheat Sheet: https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-identity-and-access-m anagement-iam/",

        ],
        "correct": "",
        "explanation": "Explanation The AWS Key Management Service (KMS) custom key sto re feature combines the controls provided by AWS CloudHSM with the integration and ease of use o f AWS KMS. You can configure your own CloudHSM cluster and authorize AWS KMS to use it as  a dedicated key store for your keys rather than th e default AWS KMS key store. When you create keys in AWS KMS you can choose to generate the key material in your CloudHSM cluster. CMKs that are ge nerated in your custom key store never leave the HSMs in the CloudHSM cluster in plaintext and all A WS KMS operations that use those keys are only performed in your HSMs. AWS KMS can help you integrate with other AWS servi ces to encrypt the data that you store in these services and control access to the keys that decryp t it. To immediately remove the key material from A WS KMS, you can use a custom key store. Take note that  each custom key store is associated with an AWS CloudHSM cluster in your AWS account. Therefore, wh en you create an AWS KMS CMK in a custom key store, AWS KMS generates and stores the non-extract able key material for the CMK in an AWS CloudHSM cluster that you own and manage. This is a lso suitable if you want to be able to audit the us age of all your keys independently of AWS KMS or AWS Cl oudTrail. Since you control your AWS CloudHSM cluster, you ha ve the option to manage the lifecycle of your CMKs independently of AWS KMS. There are four reaso ns why you might find a custom key store useful: You might have keys that are explicitly required to  be protected in a single-tenant HSM or in an HSM o ver which you have direct control. You might have keys that are required to be stored in an HSM that has been validated to FIPS 140-2 lev el 3 overall (the HSMs used in the standard AWS KMS key store are either validated or in the process of bei ng validated to level 2 with level 3 in multiple categ ories). You might need the ability to immediately remove ke y material from AWS KMS and to prove you have done so by independent means. You might have a requirement to be able to audit al l use of your keys independently of AWS KMS or AWS CloudTrail. Hence, the correct answer in this scenario is: Use AWS Key Management Service to create a CMK in a custom key store and store the non-extractable key material in AWS CloudHSM. The option that says: Use AWS Key Management Servic e to create a CMK in a custom key store and store the non-extractable key material in Amazon S3  is incorrect because Amazon S3 is not a suitable storage service to use in storing encryption keys. You have to use AWS CloudHSM instead. The options that say: Use AWS Key Management Servic e to create AWS-owned CMKs and store the non-extractable key material in AWS CloudHSM and Us e AWS Key Management Service to create AWS-managed CMKs and store the non-extractable key material in AWS CloudHSM are both incorrect because the scenario requires you to have  full control over the encryption of the created ke y. AWS-owned CMKs and AWS-managed CMKs are managed by AWS. Moreover, these options do not allow you to audit the key usage independently of A WS CloudTrail.

        ],
        "correct": "A. A. The web application is not deleting the messag es in the SQS queue after it has processed",
        "explanation": "Explanation Always remember that the messages in the SQS queue will continue to exist even after the EC2 instance has processed it, until you delete that message. Yo u have to ensure that you delete the message after processing to prevent the message from being receiv ed and processed again once the visibility timeout expires. There are three main parts in a distributed messagi ng system: 1. The components of your distributed system (EC2 i nstances) 2. Your queue (distributed on Amazon SQS servers) 3. Messages in the queue. You can set up a system which has several component s that send messages to the queue and receive messages from the queue. The queue redundantly stor es the messages across multiple Amazon SQS servers.Refer to the third step of the SQS Message Lifecycl e: Component 1 sends Message A to a queue, and the mes sage is distributed across the Amazon SQS servers redundantly. When Component 2 is ready to process a message, it consumes messages from the queue, and Message A is returned. While Message A is being processed, it  remains in the queue and isn't returned to subsequ ent receive requests for the duration of the visibility  timeout. Component 2 deletes Message A from the queue to pre vent the message from being received and processed again once the visibility timeout expires. The option that says: The web application is set fo r long polling so the messages are being sent twice  is incorrect because long polling helps reduce the cos t of using SQS by eliminating the number of empty responses (when there are no messages available for  a ReceiveMessage request) and false empty response s (when messages are available but aren't included in  a response). Messages being sent twice in an SQS queue configured with long polling is quite unlikel y. The option that says: The web application is set to  short polling so some messages are not being picke d up is incorrect since you are receiving emails from SNS w here messages are certainly being processed. Following the scenario, messages not being picked u p won't result into 20 messages being sent to your inbox. The option that says: The web application does not have permission to consume messages in the SQS queue is incorrect because not having the correct p ermissions would have resulted in a different respo nse.

Since the endpoint for your D B Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without t he need for manual administrative intervention. In this scenario, the best RDS configuration to use  is an Oracle database in RDS with Multi-AZ deployments to ensure high availability even if the  primary database instance goes down. Hence, creati ng an Oracle database in RDS with Multi-AZ deployments is  the correct answer. Launching an Oracle database instance in RDS with R ecovery Manager (RMAN) enabled and launching an Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC)  in RDS are incorrect because Oracle RMAN and RAC are not supported in RDS. The option that says: Convert the database schema u sing the AWS Schema Conversion Tool and AWS Database Migration Service. Migrate the Oracle data base to a non-cluster Amazon Aurora with a single instance is incorrect because although this solution is feasible, it takes time to migrate your  Oracle database to Aurora, which is not acceptable. Based on this option, the Aurora database is only using a  single instance with no Read Replica and is not configured  as an Amazon Aurora DB cluster, which could have improved the availability of the database.

        "explanation": "Explanation You can use CloudWatch Events to run Amazon ECS tas ks when certain AWS events occur. You can set up a CloudWatch Events rule that runs an Amazon ECS  task whenever a file is uploaded to a certain Amazon S3 bucket using the Amazon S3 PUT operation.  You can also declare a reduced number of ECS tasks whenever a file is deleted on the S3 bucket u sing the DELETE operation. First, you must create a CloudWatch Events rule for  the S3 service that will watch for object-level operations  PUT and DELETE objects. For object-leve l operations, it is required to create a CloudTrail  trail first. On the Targets section, select the \"ECS task\" and i nput the needed values such as the cluster name, ta sk definition and the task count. You need two rules  one for the scale-up and another for the scale-down  of the ECS task count. Hence, the correct answer is: Set up a CloudWatch E vent rule to detect S3 object PUT operations and set the target to the ECS cluster with the increase d number of tasks. Create another rule to detect S3  DELETE operations and set the target to the ECS Cluster wi th 1 as the Task count. The option that says: Set up a CloudWatch Event rul e to detect S3 object PUT operations and set the target to a Lambda function that will run Amazon EC S API command to increase the number of tasks on ECS. Create another rule to detect S3 DELE TE operations and run the Lambda function to reduce the number of ECS tasks is incorrect. Althou gh this solution meets the requirement, creating yo ur own Lambda function for this scenario is not really necessary. It is much simple r to control ECS task directly as target for the CloudWatch Event rule. Take note that the scenario asks for a solution that is the easiest to implemen t. The option that says: Set up an alarm in CloudWatch  to monitor CloudTrail since the S3 object-level operations are recorded on CloudTrail. Create two L ambda functions for increasing/decreasing the ECS task count. Set these as respective targets for  the CloudWatch Alarm depending on the S3 event is incorrect because using CloudTrail, CloudWatch A larm, and two Lambda functions creates an unnecessary complexity to what you want to achieve.  CloudWatch Events can directly target an ECS task on the Targets section when you create a new rule. The option that says: Set up an alarm in CloudWatch  to monitor CloudTrail since this S3 object-level operations are recorded on CloudTrail. Set two alar m actions to update ECS task count to scale- out/scale-in depending on the S3 event is incorrect  because you can't directly set CloudWatch Alarms t o update the ECS task count. You have to use CloudWatch Even ts instead.

        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Elastic Block Store (EBS) is an easy-to-use,  high-performance block storage service designed for use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for  both throughput and transaction-intensive workloads at any scale. A broad range of workloads,  such as relational and non-relational databases, enterprise applications, containerized applications , big data analytics engines, file systems, and med ia workflows are widely deployed on Amazon EBS. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an obj ect storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and perfo rmance. This means customers of all sizes and indus tries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterpri se applications, IoT devices, and big data analytic s. In an S3 Lifecycle configuration, you can define ru les to transition objects from one storage class to  another to save on storage costs. Amazon S3 supports a waterfa ll model for transitioning between storage classes,  as shown in the diagram below: In this scenario, three services are required to im plement this solution. The mission-critical workloa ds mean that you need to have a persistent block storage vo lume and the designed service for this is Amazon EB S volumes. The second workload needs to have an objec t storage service, such as Amazon S3, to store your backup data. Amazon S3 enables you to configur e the lifecycle policy from S3 Standard to differen t storage classes. For the last one, it needs archive  storage such as Amazon S3 Glacier. Hence, the correct answer in this scenario is: Atta ch an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecy cle policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier. The option that says: Attach an EBS volume in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy to tra nsition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone-IA is incorrect because this lifecycle policy will transi tion your objects into an infrequently accessed sto rage class and not a storage class for data archiving. The option that says: Attach an instance store volu me in your existing EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle  policy to transition your objects to Amazon S3 Glacier is incorrect because an Instance Store volu me is simply a temporary block-level storage for EC 2 instances. Also, you can't attach instance store vo lumes to an instance after you've launched it. You can specify the instance store volumes for your instance only w hen you launch it. The option that says: Attach an instance store volu me in your EC2 instance. Use Amazon S3 to store your backup data and configure a lifecycle policy t o transition your objects to Amazon S3 One Zone- IA is incorrect. Just like the previous option, the  use of instance store volume is not suitable for m ission- critical workloads because the data can be lost if the under lying disk drive fails, the instance stops, or if t he instance is terminated. In addition, Amazon S3 Glacier is a mor e suitable option for data archival instead of Amaz on S3 One Zone-IA.

        "explanation": "Explanation An event in CloudTrail is the record of an activity  in an AWS account. This activity can be an action taken by a user, role, or service that is monitorable by Cloud Trail. CloudTrail events provide a history of both API and non- API account activity made through the AWS Managemen t Console, AWS SDKs, command- line tools, and other AWS services. There are two t ypes of events that can be logged in CloudTrail: management events and data events. By default, trai ls log management events, but not data events. A trail can be applied to all regions or a single r egion. As a best practice, create a trail that appl ies to all regions in the AWS partition in which you are working. This  is the default setting when you create a trail in the CloudTrail console. For most services, events are recorded in the regio n where the action occurred.

        "correct": "D. D. Create a custom endpoint in Aurora based on th e specified criteria for the production",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Aurora typically involves a cluster of DB in stances instead of a single instance. Each connecti on is handled by a specific DB instance. When you conn ect to an Aurora cluster, the host name and port th at you specify point to an intermediate handler called  an endpoint. Aurora uses the endpoint mechanism to abstract these connections. Thus, you don't have to  hardcode all the hostnames or write your own logic  for load-balancing and rerouting connections when some DB instances aren't available. For certain Aurora tasks, different instances or gr oups of instances perform different roles. For exam ple, the primary instance handles all data definition langua ge (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas handle read-on ly query traffic. Using endpoints, you can map each connection to the  appropriate instance or group of instances based o n your use case. For example, to perform DDL statements yo u can connect to whichever instance is the primary instance. To perform queries, you can conne ct to the reader endpoint, with Aurora automaticall y performing load-balancing among all the Aurora Repl icas. For clusters with DB instances of different capacities or configurations, you can connect to cu stom endpoints associated with different subsets of  DB instances. For diagnosis or tuning, you can connect  to a specific instance endpoint to examine details  about a specific DB instance. The custom endpoint provides load-balanced database  connections based on criteria other than the read- only or read-write capability of the DB instances. For example, you might define a custom endpoint to connect to instances that use a particular AWS inst ance class or a particular DB parameter group. Then  you might tell particular groups of users about this cu stom endpoint. For example, you might direct intern al users to low-capacity instances for report generati on or ad hoc (one-time) querying, and direct produc tion traffic to high-capacity instances. Hence, creating  a custom endpoint in Aurora based on the specified criteria for the production traffic and another cus tom endpoint to handle the reporting queries is the correct answer. Configuring your application to use the reader endp oint for both production traffic and reporting queries, which will enable your Aurora database to automatically perform load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas is incorrect because although it is true t hat a reader endpoint enables your Aurora database to automatically perform load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas, it is quite limited to doing read operations only. You still need to use a custom end point to load-balance the database connections base d on the specified criteria. The option that says: In your application, use the instance endpoint of your Aurora database to handle  the incoming production traffic and use the cluster end point to handle reporting queries is incorrect because a cluster endpoint (also known as a writer endpoint) for an Aurora DB cluster simply connects to the current primary DB instance for that DB cluster. Th is endpoint can perform write operations in the dat abase such as DDL statements, which is perfect for handli ng production traffic but not suitable for handling  queries for reporting since there will be no write database ope rations that will be sent. Moreover, the endpoint d oes not point to lower-capacity or high-capacity instances as per the requirement. A better solution for this is to use a custom endpoint. The option that says: Do nothing since by default, Aurora will automatically direct the production traffic to your high-capacity instances and the rep orting queries to your low-capacity instances is incorrect because Aurora does not do this by defaul t. You have to create custom endpoints in order to accomplish this requirement.",

        "explanation": "Explanation/Reference: Explanation The Amazon S3 notification feature enables you to r eceive notifications when certain events happen in your bucket. To enable notifications, you must firs t add a notification configuration that identifies the events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destinations wher e you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications. You store this configuration in the notification subresource that is associated with a bucket. Amazon S3 supports the following destinations where  it can publish events: - Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) t opic - Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue - AWS Lambda In Amazon SNS, the fanout scenario is when a messag e published to an SNS topic is replicated and pushe d to multiple endpoints, such as Amazon SQS queues, HTTP (S) endpoints, and Lambda functions. This allows for parallel asynchronous processing. For example, you can develop an application that pu blishes a message to an SNS topic whenever an order  is placed for a product. Then, SQS queues that are sub scribed to the SNS topic receive identical notifications for the new order. An Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) server instance attached to one of the SQS queues can handle the pr ocessing or fulfillment of the order. And you can a ttach another Amazon EC2 server instance to a data wareho use for analysis of all orders received. Based on the given scenario, the existing setup sen ds the event notification to an SQS queue. Since yo u need to send the notification to the development and ope rations team, you can use a combination of Amazon SNS and SQS. By using the message fanout pat tern, you can create a topic and use two Amazon SQS queues to subscribe to the topic. If Amazon SNS  receives an event notification, it will publish th e message to both subscribers. Take note that Amazon S3 event notifications are de signed to be delivered at least once and to one destination only. You cannot attach two or more SNS  topics or SQS queues for S3 event notification. Therefore, you must send the event notification to Amazon SNS. Hence, the correct answer is: Create an Amazon SNS topic and configure two Amazon SQS queues to subscribe to the topic. Grant Amazon S3 permission to send notifications to Amazon SNS and update the bucket to use the new SNS topic. The option that says: Set up another Amazon SQS que ue for the other team. Grant Amazon S3 permission to send a notification to the second SQS  queue is incorrect because you can only add 1 SQS or SNS at a time for Amazon S3 events notification.  If you need to send the events to multiple subscri bers, you should implement a message fanout pattern with Amaz on SNS and Amazon SQS. The option that says: Create a new Amazon SNS FIFO topic for the other team. Grant Amazon S3 permission to send the notification to the second S NS topic is incorrect. Just as mentioned in the previous option, you can only add 1 SQS or SNS at a  time for Amazon S3 events notification. In additio n, neither Amazon SNS FIFO topic nor Amazon SQS FIFO q ueue is warranted in this scenario. Both of them can be used together to provide strict message orde ring and message deduplication. The FIFO capabiliti es of each of these services work together to act as a fu lly managed service to integrate distributed applications that require data consistency in near- real-time. The option that says: Set up an Amazon SNS topic an d configure two Amazon SQS queues to poll the SNS topic. Grant Amazon S3 permission to send notif ications to Amazon SNS and update the bucket to use the new SNS topic is incorrect because you c an't poll Amazon SNS. Instead of configuring queues  to poll Amazon SNS, you should configure each Amazon SQS qu eue to subscribe to the SNS topic.

A Soluti ons Architect has been instructed to create a cost-effe ctive solution without affecting the performance of  the application. Which dynamic scaling policy should be used to sati sfy this requirement?",
        "options": [
            "A. A. Use simple scaling.",
            "B. B. Use suspend and resume scaling.",
            "C. C. Use scheduled scaling.",
            "D. D. Use target tracking scaling."
        ],
        "correct": "D. D. Use target tracking scaling.",
        "explanation": "Explanation An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amaz on EC2 instances that are treated as a logical grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. An Auto Scaling group also enables you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as hea lth check replacements and scaling policies. Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scal ing group and automatic scaling are the core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling servic e. The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired cap acity. You can adjust its size to meet demand, eith er manually or by using automatic scaling. Step scaling policies and simple scaling policies a re two of the dynamic scaling options available for  you to use. Both require you to create CloudWatch alarms for th e scaling policies. Both require you to specify the  high and low thresholds for the alarms. Both require you to define whether to add or remove instances, and how many, or set the group to an exact size. The main differe nce between the policy types is the step adjustments that you get with step scaling policies . When step adjustments are applied, and they incre ase or decrease the current capacity of your Auto Scaling group, the adjustments vary based on the size of th e alarm breach. The primary issue with simple scaling is that after  a scaling activity is started, the policy must wai t for the scaling activity or health check replacement to com plete and the cooldown period to expire before responding to additional alarms. Cooldown periods h elp to prevent the initiation of additional scaling  activities before the effects of previous activities are visib le. With a target tracking scaling policy, you can incr ease or decrease the current capacity of the group based on a target value for a specific metric. This policy wil l help resolve the over-provisioning of your resour ces. The scaling policy adds or removes capacity as required  to keep the metric at, or close to, the specified target value. In addition to keeping the metric close to the targ et value, a target tracking scaling policy also adj usts to changes in the metric due to a changing load patter n. Hence, the correct answer is: Use target tracking s caling. The option that says: Use simple scaling is incorre ct because you need to wait for the cooldown period  to complete before initiating additional scaling activ ities. Target tracking or step scaling policies can  trigger a scaling activity immediately without waiting for th e cooldown period to expire. The option that says: Use scheduled scaling is inco rrect because this policy is mainly used for predic table traffic patterns. You need to use the target tracking scali ng policy to optimize the cost of your infrastructu re without affecting the performance. The option that says: Use suspend and resume scalin g is incorrect because this type is used to tempora rily pause scaling activities triggered by your scaling policies and scheduled actions.

        "explanation": "Explanation AWS CloudTrail is a service that enables governance , compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditi ng of your AWS account. With CloudTrail, you can log, con tinuously monitor, and retain account activity related to actions across your AWS infrastructure. By default, CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS accou nt when you create it. When activity occurs in your AWS account, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event. You can easily v iew recent events in the CloudTrail console by going to Event history. CloudTrail provides event history of your AWS accou nt activity, including actions taken through the AW S Management Console, AWS SDKs, command line tools, A PI calls, and other AWS services. This event history simplifies security analysis, resource chan ge tracking, and troubleshooting. Hence, the correct answer is: AWS CloudTrail. Amazon CloudWatch is incorrect. Although this is al so a monitoring service, it cannot track the API ca lls to your AWS resources. AWS X-Ray is incorrect because this is not a suitab le service to use to track each API call to your AW S resources. It just helps you debug and analyze your  microservices applications with request tracing so  you can find the root cause of issues and performance. Amazon Redshift Spectrum is incorrect because this is not a monitoring service but rather a feature of  Amazon Redshift that enables you to query and analyze all of your data in Amazon S3 using the open data forma ts you already use, with no data loading or transformation s needed.

        "correct": "D. D. Create an API using Amazon API Gateway and use  AWS Lambda to handle the bursts of",
        "explanation": "Explanation AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning o r managing servers. You pay only for the compute time you consume. With Lambda, you can run code for  virtually any type of application or backend servi ce - all with zero administration. Just upload your co de, and Lambda takes care of everything required to  run and scale your code with high availability. You can  set up your code to automatically trigger from oth er AWS services or call it directly from any web or mo bile app. The first time you invoke your function, AWS Lambda  creates an instance of the function and runs its handler method to process the event. When the funct ion returns a response, it stays active and waits t o process additional events. If you invoke the functi on again while the first event is being processed, Lambda initializes another instance, and the function proc esses the two events concurrently. As more events c ome in, Lambda routes them to available instances and c reates new instances as needed. When the number of requests decreases, Lambda stops unused instances t o free up the scaling capacity for other functions. Your functions' concurrency is the number of instan ces that serve requests at a given time. For an ini tial burst of traffic, your functions' cumulative concurrency in a Region can reach an initial level of between 5 00 and 3000, which varies per Region. Based on the given scenario, you need to create a s olution that will satisfy the two requirements. The  first requirement is to create a solution that will allow  the users to access the data using an API. To impl ement this solution, you can use Amazon API Gateway. The secon d requirement is to handle the burst of traffic wit hin seconds. You should use AWS Lambda in this scenario  because Lambda functions can absorb reasonable bursts of traffic for approximately 15-3 0 minutes. Lambda can scale faster than the regular Auto Scali ng feature of Amazon EC2, Amazon Elastic Beanstalk,  or Amazon ECS. This is because AWS Lambda is more ligh tweight than other computing services. Under the hood, Lambda can run your code to thousands of available AWS-managed EC2 instances (that could already be running) within seconds to accommodate t raffic. This is faster than the Auto Scaling proces s of launching new EC2 instances that could take a few m inutes or so. An alternative is to overprovision yo ur compute capacity but that will incur significant co sts. The best option to implement given the require ments is a combination of AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway. Hence, the correct answer is: Create an API using A mazon API Gateway and use AWS Lambda to handle the bursts of traffic. The option that says: Create an API using Amazon AP I Gateway and use the Amazon ECS cluster with Service Auto Scaling to handle the bursts of t raffic in seconds is incorrect. AWS Lambda is a better option than Amazon ECS since it can handle a  sudden burst of traffic within seconds and not min utes. The option that says: Create an API using Amazon AP I Gateway and use Amazon Elastic Beanstalk with Auto Scaling to handle the bursts of traffic i n seconds is incorrect because just like the previo us option, the use of Auto Scaling has a delay of a few minutes as it lau nches new EC2 instances that will be used by Amazon Elastic Beanstalk. The option that says: Create an API using Amazon AP I Gateway and use an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances to handle the bursts of traffi c in seconds is incorrect because the processing time of Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to provision new re sources takes minutes. Take note that in the scenar io, a burst of traffic within seconds is expected to happ en.

        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon CloudWatch has available Amazon EC2 Metrics for you to use for monitoring CPU utilization, Network utilization, Disk performance, and Disk Rea ds/Writes. In case you need to monitor the below items, you need to prepare a custom metric using a Perl or other shell script, as there are no ready t o use metrics for: Memory utilization Disk swap utilization Disk space utilization Page file utilization Log collection Take note that there is a multi-platform CloudWatch  agent which can be installed on both Linux and Windows-based instances. You can use a single agent  to collect both system metrics and log files from Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers. This agent supports both Windows Server and Linux and enables you to select the metrics to be collected, including sub-resource metrics such as per-CPU core . It is recommended that you use the new agent instead of t he older monitoring scripts to collect metrics and logs. Hence, the correct answer is: Install the CloudWatc h agent to all the EC2 instances that gathers the memory and disk utilization data. View the custom m etrics in the Amazon CloudWatch console. The option that says: Use the default CloudWatch co nfiguration to EC2 instances where the memory and disk utilization metrics are already available.  Install the AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Agent to all the EC2 instances is incorrect because, by defa ult, CloudWatch does not automatically provide memory and disk utilization metrics of your instanc es. You have to set up custom CloudWatch metrics to monitor the memory, disk swap, disk space, and page  file utilization of your instances. The option that says: Enable the Enhanced Monitorin g option in EC2 and install CloudWatch agent to all the EC2 instances to be able to view the memory  and disk utilization in the CloudWatch dashboard is incorrect because Enhanced Monitoring is a feature of Amazon RDS. By default, Enhanced Monitoring metrics are stored for 30 days in the Cl oudWatch Logs. The option that says: Use Amazon Inspector and inst all the Inspector agent to all EC2 instances is incorrect because Amazon Inspector is an automated security assessment service that helps you test the network accessibility of your Amazon EC2 instances and the security state of your applications running  on the instances.

        ],
        "correct": "B. B. Amazon DynamoDB",
        "explanation": "Explanation Before we proceed in answering this question, we mu st first be clear with the actual definition of a \"schema\". Basically, the english definition of a sc hema is: a representation of a plan or theory in th e form of an outline or model. Just think of a schema as the \"structure\" or a \"mod el\" of your data in your database. Since the scenar io requires that the schema, or the structure of your data, changes frequently, then you have to pick a d atabase which provides a non-rigid and flexible way of addi ng or removing new types of data. This is a classic  example of choosing between a relational database and non-r elational (NoSQL) database. A relational database is known for having a rigid s chema, with a lot of constraints and limits as to w hich (and what type of ) data can be inserted or not. It is p rimarily used for scenarios where you have to suppo rt complex queries which fetch data across a number of tables.  It is best for scenarios where you have complex table relationships but for use cases where  you need to have a flexible schema, this is not a suitable database to use. For NoSQL, it is not as rigid as a relational datab ase because you can easily add or remove rows or elements in your table/collection entry. It also ha s a more flexible schema because it can store compl ex hierarchical data within a single item which, unlik e a relational database, does not entail changing m ultiple related tables. Hence, the best answer to be used h ere is a NoSQL database, like DynamoDB. When your business requires a low-latency response to high-tr affic queries, taking advantage of a NoSQL system generally makes technical and economic sense. Amazon DynamoDB helps solve the problems that limit  the relational system scalability by avoiding them . In DynamoDB, you design your schema specifically to  make the most common and important queries as fast and as inexpensive as possible. Your data stru ctures are tailored to the specific requirements of  your business use cases. Remember that a relational database system does not  scale well for the following reasons: - It normalizes data and stores it on multiple tabl es that require multiple queries to write to disk. - It generally incurs the performance costs of an A CID-compliant transaction system. - It uses expensive joins to reassemble required vi ews of query results. For DynamoDB, it scales well due to these reasons: - Its schema flexibility lets DynamoDB store comple x hierarchical data within a single item. DynamoDB is not a totally schemaless database since the very  definition of a schema is just the model or struct ure of your data. - Composite key design lets it store related items close together on the same table. An Amazon RDS instance in Multi-AZ Deployments conf iguration and an Amazon Aurora database with Read Replicas are incorrect because both of th em are a type of relational database. Redshift is incorrect because it is primarily used for OLAP systems.

The option that says: API Gateway will automaticall y scale and handle massive traffic spikes so you do  not have to do anything is incorrect. Although it can s cale using AWS Edge locations, you still need to co nfigure the throttling to further manage the bursts of your API s.

        "correct": "",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets. An  object is a file and any optional metadata that describes the file. To store a file in Amazon S3, y ou upload it to a bucket. When you upload a file as  an object, you can set permissions on the object and any metad ata. Buckets are containers for objects. You can ha ve one or more buckets. You can control access for each bu cket, deciding who can create, delete, and list obj ects in it. You can also choose the geographical region where A mazon S3 will store the bucket and its contents and  view access logs for the bucket and its objects. To move a file to a different storage class, you ca n use Amazon S3 or Amazon EFS. Both services have lifecycle configurations. Take note that Amazon EFS  can only transition a file to the IA storage class  after 90 days. Since you need to move the files that are old er than 2 years to a more cost-effective and scalab le solution, you should use the Amazon S3 lifecycle co nfiguration. With S3 lifecycle rules, you can trans ition files to S3 Standard IA or S3 Glacier. Using S3 Glacier e xpedited retrieval, you can quickly access your fil es within 1-5 minutes. Hence, the correct answers are: - Use Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy that will move the objects to Amazon S3 Glacier after 2 years. - Use Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy that will move the objects to Amazon S3 Standard-IA after 2 years. The option that says: Use Amazon EFS and create a l ifecycle policy that will move the objects to Amazon EFS-IA after 2 years is incorrect because th e maximum days for the EFS lifecycle policy is only  90 days. The requirement is to move the files that are  older than 2 years or 730 days. The option that says: Use Amazon EBS volumes to sto re the files. Configure the Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM) to schedule snapshots of th e volumes after 2 years is incorrect because Amazon EBS costs more and is not as scalable as Ama zon S3. It has some limitations when accessed by multiple EC2 instances. There are also huge costs i nvolved in using the multi-attach feature on a Provisioned IOPS EBS volume to allow multiple EC2 i nstances to access the volume. The option that says: Use a RAID 0 storage configur ation that stripes multiple Amazon EBS volumes together to store the files. Configure the Amazon D ata Lifecycle Manager (DLM) to schedule snapshots of the volumes after 2 years is incorrect  because RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) is just a data storage virtualization techno logy that combines multiple storage devices to achi eve higher performance or data durability. RAID 0 can stripe m ultiple volumes together for greater I/O performance than you can achieve with a single volu me. On the other hand, RAID 1 can mirror two volumes together to achieve on-instance redundancy.

        "explanation": "Explanation Client-side encryption is the act of encrypting dat a before sending it to Amazon S3. To enable client- side encryption, you have the following options: - Use an AWS KMS-managed customer master key. - Use a client-side master key. When using an AWS KMS-managed customer master key t o enable client-side data encryption, you provide an AWS KMS customer master key ID (CMK ID) to AWS. On the other hand, when you use client-side master key for client-side data encrypt ion, your client-side master keys and your unencryp ted data are never sent to AWS. It's important that you  safely manage your encryption keys because if you lose them, you can't decrypt your data. This is how client-side encryption using client-sid e master key works: When uploading an object - You provide a client-sid e master key to the Amazon S3 encryption client. The client uses the master key only to encrypt the data encryption key that it generates randomly. The process works like this: 1. The Amazon S3 encryption client generates a one- time-use symmetric key (also known as a data encryption key or data key) locally. It uses the da ta key to encrypt the data of a single Amazon S3 ob ject. The client generates a separate data key for each o bject. 2. The client encrypts the data encryption key usin g the master key that you provide. The client uploa ds the encrypted data key and its material description as part of the object metadata. The client uses the ma terial description to determine which client-side master k ey to use for decryption. 3. The client uploads the encrypted data to Amazon S3 and saves the encrypted data key as object metad ata (x-amz-meta-x-amz-key) in Amazon S3. When downloading an object - The client downloads t he encrypted object from Amazon S3. Using the material description from the object's metadata, th e client determines which master key to use to decr ypt the data key. The client uses that master key to de crypt the data key and then uses the data key to de crypt the object. Hence, the correct answer is to use S3 client-side encryption with a client-side master key. Using S3 client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key is incorrect because in client-side encryption with a KMS-managed customer master key, you provide an AWS KMS customer master key ID (CMK ID) to AWS. The scenario clearly  indicates that both the master keys and the unencrypted data should never be sent to AWS. Using S3 server-side encryption with a KMS managed key is incorrect because the scenario mentioned that the unencrypted data should never be sent to A WS, which means that you have to use client-side encryption in order to encrypt the data first befor e sending to AWS. In this way, you can ensure that there is no unencrypted data being uploaded to AWS. In ad dition, the master key used by Server-Side Encrypti on with AWS KMSManaged Keys (SSE-KMS) is uploaded and managed by AWS, which directly violates the requirement of not uploading the master key. Using S3 server-side encryption with customer provi ded key is incorrect because just as mentioned above, you have to use client-side encryption in th is scenario instead of server-side encryption. For the S3 server-side encryption with customer-provided key ( SSE-C), you actually provide the encryption key as part of your request to upload the object to S3. Us ing this key, Amazon S3 manages both the encryption  (as it writes to disks) and decryption (when you access yo ur objects).

        "explanation": "Explanation A NAT Gateway is a highly available, managed Networ k Address Translation (NAT) service for your resources in a private subnet to access the Interne t. NAT gateway is created in a specific Availabilit y Zone and implemented with redundancy in that zone. You must create a NAT gateway on a public subnet to  enable instances in a private subnet to connect to  the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the Int ernet from initiating a connection with those insta nces. If you have resources in multiple Availability Zone s and they share one NAT gateway, and if the NAT gateway's Availability Zone is down, resources in t he other Availability Zones lose Internet access. T o create an Availability Zone-independent architecture, create a NAT gateway in each Availability Zone and configu re your routing to ensure that resources use the NAT gatewa y in the same Availability Zone. Hence, the correct answer is: Create a NAT Gateway in each availability zone. Configure the route table in each private subnet to ensure that instanc es use the NAT Gateway in the same availability zone. The option that says: Create a NAT Gateway in each availability zone. Configure the route table in each public subnet to ensure that instances use the  NAT Gateway in the same availability zone is incorrect because you should configure the route ta ble in the private subnet and not the public subnet  to associate the right instances in the private subnet . The options that say: Create two NAT Gateways in ea ch availability zone. Configure the route table in each public subnet to ensure that instances use the  NAT Gateway in the same availability zone and Create three NAT Gateways in each availability zone . Configure the route table in each private subnet to ensure that instances use the NAT Gateway  in the same availability zone are both incorrect because a single NAT Gateway in each availability z one is enough. NAT Gateway is already redundant in nature, meaning, AWS already handles any failures t hat occur in your NAT Gateway in an availability zo ne.

        "explanation": "Explanation Scaling based on a schedule allows you to scale you r application in response to predictable load chang es. For example, every week the traffic to your web applica tion starts to increase on Wednesday, remains high on Thursday, and starts to decrease on Friday. You can  plan your scaling activities based on the predicta ble traffic patterns of your web application. To configure your Auto Scaling group to scale based  on a schedule, you create a scheduled action. The scheduled action tells Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to p erform a scaling action at specified times. To crea te a scheduled scaling action, you specify the start tim e when the scaling action should take effect, and t he new minimum, maximum, and desired sizes for the scaling  action. At the specified time, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling updates the group with the values for minim um, maximum, and desired size specified by the scaling action. You can create scheduled actions fo r scaling one time only or for scaling on a recurri ng schedule. Hence, configuring a Scheduled scaling policy for t he Auto Scaling group to launch new instances before the start of the day is the correct answer. You need to configure a Scheduled scaling policy. T his will ensure that the instances are already scaled up and  ready before the start of the day since this is wh en the application is used the most. Configuring a Dynamic scaling policy for the Auto S caling group to launch new instances based on the CPU utilization and configuring a Dynamic scali ng policy for the Auto Scaling group to launch new instances based on the Memory utilization are b oth incorrect because although these are valid solutions, it is still better to configure a Schedu led scaling policy as you already know the exact pe ak hours of your application. By the time either the CPU or Mem ory hits a peak, the application already has performance issues, so you need to ensure the scali ng is done beforehand using a Scheduled scaling pol icy. Setting up an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to yo ur architecture to ensure that the traffic is properly distributed on the instances is incorrect.  Although the Application load balancer can also balance the traffic, it cannot increase the instanc es based on demand.",

It's a simple storage service that offers industry- leading durability, availability, performance, secu rity, and virtually unlimited scalability at very low costs. Amazon S3 is also designed to be highly flexible. S tore any type and amount of data that you want; read the  same piece of data a million times or only for emergency disaster recovery; build a simple FTP app lication or a sophisticated web application. Since the weather forecasting application is locate d in N.Virginia, you need to transfer all the data in the same AWS Region. With Amazon S3 Transfer Accelerati on, you can speed up content transfers to and from Amazon S3 by as much as 50-500% for long-distance transfer of  larger objects. Multipart upload allows you to upl oad a single object as a set of parts. After all the pa rts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 then pre sents the data as a single object. This approach is the faste st way to aggregate all the data. Hence, the correct answer is: Enable Transfer Accel eration in the destination bucket and upload the collected data using Multipart Upload. The option that says: Upload the data to the closes t S3 bucket. Set up a cross-region replication and copy the objects to the destination bucket is incor rect because replicating the objects to the destina tion bucket takes about 15 minutes. Take note that the r equirement in the scenario is to aggregate the data  in the fastest way. The option that says: Use AWS Snowball Edge to tran sfer large amounts of data is incorrect because the end-to-end time to transfer up to 80 TB of data  into AWS Snowball Edge is approximately one week. The option that says: Set up a Site-to-Site VPN con nection is incorrect because setting up a VPN connection is not needed in this scenario.

SSD-backed volumes, such as General Purpos e SSD (gp2) and Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1), deliver consistent performance whether an I/O opera tion is random or sequential. HDD-backed volumes like Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) and Cold HDD (sc1) deliver opti mal performance only when I/O operations are large and sequential. In the exam, always consider the difference between  SSD and HDD as shown on the table below. This will allow you to easily eliminate specific EBS-types in  the options which are not SSD or not HDD, dependin g on whether the question asks for a storage type which has small, random I/O operations or large, sequential I/O operations. Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes are designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly database workloads, that are sensitive  to storage performance and consistency. Unlike gp2 , which uses a bucket and credit model to calculate p erformance, an io1 volume allows you to specify a consistent IOPS rate when you create the volume, an d Amazon EBS delivers within 10 percent of the provisioned IOPS performance 99.9 percent of the ti me over a given year. General Purpose SSD (gp2) is incorrect because alth ough General Purpose is a type of SSD that can handle small, random I/O operations, the Provisione d IOPS SSD volumes are much more suitable to meet the needs of I/O-intensive database workloads such as MongoDB, Oracle, MySQL, and many others. Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) and Cold HDD (sc1) a re incorrect because HDD volumes (such as Throughput Optimized HDD and Cold HDD volumes) are more suitable for workloads with large, sequential I/O operations instead of small, random I/O operations.

        "explanation": "Explanation AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) is a service that  enables you to easily and securely share AWS resources with any AWS account or within your AWS O rganization. You can share AWS Transit Gateways, Subnets, AWS License Manager configuratio ns, and Amazon Route 53 Resolver rules resources with RAM. Many organizations use multiple accounts to create administrative or billing isolation, and limit the impact of errors. RAM eliminates the need to create duplicate  resources in multiple accounts, reducing the operational overhead of managing those resources in  every single account you own. You can create resources centrally in a multi-account environment,  and use RAM to share those resources across accoun ts in three simple steps: create a Resource Share, specif y resources, and specify accounts. RAM is available  to you at no additional charge. You can procure AWS resources centrally, and use RA M to share resources such as subnets or License Manager configurations with other accounts. This el iminates the need to provision duplicate resources in every account in a multi-account environment, reducing th e operational overhead of managing those resources in every account. AWS Organizations is an account management service that lets you consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization that you create and centrally manage. With Organizations, you can create member accounts and invite existing accounts to join your organization. You can organize those accounts into groups and attach policy-based controls. Hence, the correct combination of options in this s cenario is: - Consolidate all of the company's accounts using A WS Organizations. - Use the AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM) service  to easily and securely share your resources with your AWS accounts. The option that says: Use the AWS Identity and Acce ss Management service to set up cross-account access that will easily and securely share your res ources with your AWS accounts is incorrect because although you can delegate access to resources that are in different AWS accounts using IAM, this proce ss is extremely tedious and entails a lot of operational overhead since you have to manually set up cross- a ccount access to each and every AWS account of the company . A better solution is to use AWS Resources Access Manager instead. The option that says: Use AWS Control Tower to easi ly and securely share your resources with your AWS accounts is incorrect because AWS Control Tower  simply offers the easiest way to set up and govern  a new, secure, multi-account AWS environment. This is  not the most suitable service to use to securely s hare your resources across AWS accounts or within your O rganization. You have to use AWS Resources Access Manager (RAM) instead. The option that says: Consolidate all of the compan y's accounts using AWS ParallelCluster is incorrect because AWS ParallelCluster is simply an AWS-suppor ted open-source cluster management tool that makes it easy for you to deploy and manage High-Per formance Computing (HPC) clusters on AWS. In this particular scenario, it is more appropriate to use AWS Organizations to consolidate all of your AWS accounts.

        "explanation": "Explanation The question refers to one of the common scenarios for temporary credentials in AWS. Temporary credentials are useful in scenarios that involve id entity federation, delegation, cross-account access , and IAM roles. In this example, it is called enterprise  identity federation considering that you also need  to set up a single sign-on (SSO) capability. The correct answers are: - Setup a Federation proxy or an Identity provider - Setup an AWS Security Token Service to generate t emporary tokens - Configure an IAM role and an IAM Policy to access  the bucket. In an enterprise identity federation, you can authe nticate users in your organization's network, and t hen provide those users access to AWS without creating new AWS identities for them and requiring them to sign in with a separate user name and password. Thi s is known as the single sign-on (SSO) approach to temporary access. AWS STS supports open standards l ike Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0, with which you can use Microsoft AD FS to leve rage your Microsoft Active Directory. You can also use SAML 2.0 to manage your own solution for federa ting user identities. Using 3rd party Single Sign-On solutions such as At lassian Crowd, OKTA, OneLogin and many others is incorrect since you don't have to use 3rd  party solutions to provide the access. AWS already provides the necessary tools that you can use in th is situation. Mapping each individual user to a designated user f older in S3 using Amazon WorkDocs to access their personal documents is incorrect as there is n o direct way of integrating Amazon S3 with Amazon WorkDocs for this particular scenario. Amazon WorkD ocs is simply a fully managed, secure content creation, storage, and collaboration service. With Amazon WorkDocs, you ca n easily create, edit, and share content. And becau se it's stored centrally on AWS, you can access it fro m anywhere on any device. Setting up a matching IAM user for each of the 1200  users in your corporate directory that needs access to a folder in the S3 bucket is incorrect si nce creating that many IAM users would be unnecessa ry.

For this scenario, enabling Mu lti- AZ failover is the correct answer. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and syn chronously replicates the data to a standby instanc e in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on i ts own physically distinct, independent infrastruct ure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS pe rforms an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Making a snapshot of the database allows you to hav e a backup of your database, but it does not provid e immediate availability in case of AZ failure. So th is is incorrect. Increasing the database instance size is not a solu tion for this problem. Doing this action addresses the need to upgrade your compute capacity but does not solve th e requirement of providing access to your database even in the event of a loss of one of the Availability Zones.

        "correct": "B. B. Enable throttling limits and result caching in  API Gateway.",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon API Gateway provides throttling at multiple levels including global and by service call. Thrott ling limits can be set for standard rates and bursts. Fo r example, API owners can set a rate limit of 1,000 requests per second for a specific method in their REST APIs, and also configure Amazon API Gateway to handle a burst of 2,000 requests per second for a f ew seconds. Amazon API Gateway tracks the number of requests per second. Any request over the limit wil l receive a 429 HTTP response. The client SDKs generated by Amazon API Gateway retry calls automat ically when met with this response. Hence, enabling throttling limits and result caching in AP I Gateway is the correct answer. You can add caching to API calls by provisioning an  Amazon API Gateway cache and specifying its size i n gigabytes. The cache is provisioned for a specific stage of your APIs. This improves performance and reduces the traffic sent to your back end. Cache se ttings allow you to control the way the cache key i s built and the time-to-live (TTL) of the data stored for e ach method. Amazon API Gateway also exposes management APIs that help you invalidate the cache for each stage. The option that says: Switch from using AWS Lambda and API Gateway to a more scalable and highly available architecture using EC2 instances, ELB, and Auto Scaling is incorrect since there is n o need to transfer your applications to other services. Using CloudFront in front of the API Gateway to act  as a cache is incorrect because CloudFront only speeds up content delivery which provides a better latency experience for your users.

        ],
        "correct": "A. A. Launch a new file gateway that connects to you r on-premises data center using AWS",
        "explanation": "Explanation A file gateway supports a file interface into Amazo n Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and combines a  service and a virtual software appliance. By using this combination, you can store and retrieve object s in Amazon S3 using industry-standard file protocols su ch as Network File System (NFS) and Server Message Block (SMB). The software appliance, or gateway, is  deployed into your on-premises environment as a virtual machine (VM) running on VMware ESXi, Micros oft Hyper-V, or Linux Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) hypervisor. The gateway provides access to objects in S3 as fil es or file share mount points. With a file gateway,  you can do the following: - You can store and retrieve files directly using t he NFS version 3 or 4.1 protocol. - You can store and retrieve files directly using t he SMB file system version, 2 and 3 protocol. - You can access your data directly in Amazon S3 fr om any AWS Cloud application or service. - You can manage your Amazon S3 data using lifecycl e policies, cross-region replication, and versionin g. You can think of a file gateway as a file system mo unt on S3. AWS Storage Gateway supports the Amazon S3 Standard , Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access, Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access and Amazon Gla cier storage classes. When you create or update a file share, you have the option to select a storage  class for your objects. You can either choose the Amazon S3 Standard or any of the infrequent access storage cl asses such as S3 Standard IA or S3 One Zone IA. Objects stored in any of these storage classes can be transitioned to Amazon Glacier using a Lifecycle  Policy. Although you can write objects directly from a file  share to the S3-Standard-IA or S3-One Zone-IA stor age class, it is recommended that you use a Lifecycle P olicy to transition your objects rather than write directly from the file share, especially if you're expecting to u pdate or delete the object within 30 days of archiv ing it. Therefore, the correct answer is: Launch a new file  gateway that connects to your on-premises data center using AWS Storage Gateway. Upload the docume nts to the file gateway and set up a lifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for data archi val. The option that says: Launch a new tape gateway tha t connects to your on-premises data center using AWS Storage Gateway. Upload the documents to the ta pe gateway and set up a lifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for archival is incorrec t because although tape gateways provide cost- effective and durable archive backup data in Amazon  Glacier, it does not meet the criteria of being retrievable immediately within minutes. It also doe sn't maintain a local cache that provides low laten cy access to the recently accessed data and reduce data egres s charges. Thus, it is still better to set up a fil e gateway instead. The option that says: Establish a Direct Connect co nnection to integrate your on-premises network to your VPC. Upload the documents on Amazon EBS Volume s and use a lifecycle policy to automatically move the EBS snapshots to an S3 bucke t, and then later to Glacier for archival is incorrect because EBS Volumes are not as durable co mpared with S3 and it would be more cost-efficient if you directly store the documents to an S3 bucket. An al ternative solution is to use AWS Direct Connect wit h AWS Storage Gateway to create a connection for high-thr oughput workload needs, providing a dedicated network connection between your on-premis es file gateway and AWS. But this solution is using  EBS, hence, this option is still wrong. The option that says: Use AWS Snowmobile to migrate  all of the files from the on-premises network. Upload the documents to an S3 bucket and set up a l ifecycle policy to move the data into Glacier for archival is incorrect because Snowmobile is mainly used to migrate the entire data of an on-premises d ata center to AWS. This is not a suitable approach as t he company still has a hybrid cloud architecture wh ich means that they will still use their on-premises da ta center along with their AWS cloud infrastructure .

        ],
        "correct": "D. D. Use Signed Cookies to control who can access t he private files in your CloudFront",
        "explanation": "Explanation CloudFront signed URLs and signed cookies provide t he same basic functionality: they allow you to control who can access your content. If you want to  serve private content through CloudFront and you'r e trying to decide whether to use signed URLs or signed cook ies, consider the following: Use signed URLs for the following cases: - You want to use an RTMP distribution. Signed cook ies aren't supported for RTMP distributions. - You want to restrict access to individual files, for example, an installation download for your appl ication. - Your users are using a client (for example, a cus tom HTTP client) that doesn't support cookies. Use signed cookies for the following cases: - You want to provide access to multiple restricted  files, for example, all of the files for a video i n HLS format or all of the files in the subscribers' area  of a website. - You don't want to change your current URLs. Hence, the correct answer for this scenario is the option that says: Use Signed Cookies to control who  can access the private files in your CloudFront distrib ution by modifying your application to determine whether a user should have access to your content. For members, send the required Set-Cookie headers to the viewer which will unlock the content  only to them. The option that says: Configure your CloudFront dis tribution to use Match Viewer as its Origin Protocol Policy which will automatically match the user request. This will allow access to the private content if the request is a paying member and deny it if it is not a member is incorrect because a Mat ch Viewer is an Origin Protocol Policy which configure s CloudFront to communicate with your origin using HTTP or HTTPS, depending on the protocol of the vie wer request. CloudFront caches the object only once even if viewers make requests using both HTTP and H TTPS protocols. The option that says: Create a Signed URL with a cu stom policy which only allows the members to see the private files is incorrect because Signed URLs are primarily used for providing access to individu al files, as shown on the above explanation. In additi on, the scenario explicitly says that they don't wa nt to change their current URLs which is why implementing  Signed Cookies is more suitable than Signed URL. The option that says: Configure your CloudFront dis tribution to use Field-Level Encryption to protect your private data and only allow access to members is incorrect because Field-Level Encryption only allows you to securely upload user-submitted sensit ive information to your web servers. It does not pr ovide access to download multiple private files.",

        ],
        "correct": "C. C. Set up security rules that block SQL injection  and cross-site scripting attacks in AWS Web",
        "explanation": "Explanation AWS WAF is a web application firewall that lets you  monitor the HTTP and HTTPS requests that are forwarded to an Amazon API Gateway API, Amazon Clou dFront or an Application Load Balancer. AWS WAF also lets you control access to your content. B ased on conditions that you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the value s of query strings, API Gateway, CloudFront or an Application Load Balancer responds to requests eith er with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code (Forbidden). You also can configure Clo udFront to return a custom error page when a reques t is blocked. At the simplest level, AWS WAF lets you choose one of the following behaviors: Allow all requests except the ones that you specify   This is useful when you want CloudFront or an Application Load Balancer to serve content for a pu blic website, but you also want to block requests f rom attackers. Block all requests except the ones that you specify   This is useful when you want to serve content for  a restricted website whose users are readily identifi able by properties in web requests, such as the IP addresses that they use to browse to the website. Count the requests that match the properties that y ou specify  When you want to allow or block requests based on new properties in web requests, y ou first can configure AWS WAF to count the request s that match those properties without allowing or blo cking those requests. This lets you confirm that yo u didn't accidentally configure AWS WAF to block all the traffic to your website. When you're confident that you specified t he correct properties, you can change the behavior to allow or  block requests. Hence, the correct answer in this scenario is: Set up security rules that block SQL injection and cros s- site scripting attacks in AWS Web Application Firewall ( WAF). Associate the rules to the Application Load Balancer. Using Amazon GuardDuty to prevent any further SQL i njection and cross-site scripting attacks in your application is incorrect because Amazon GuardD uty is just a threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and un authorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts an d workloads. Using AWS Firewall Manager to set up security rules  that block SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks, then associating the rules to th e Application Load Balancer is incorrect because AWS Firewall Manager just simplifies your AWS WAF a nd AWS Shield Advanced administration and maintenance tasks across multiple accounts and reso urces. Blocking all the IP addresses where the SQL injecti on and cross-site scripting attacks originated using the Network Access Control List is incorrect because this is an optional layer of security for y our VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and o ut of one or more subnets.

        "explanation": "Explanation By default, instances that you launch into a virtua l private cloud (VPC) can't communicate with your o wn network. You can enable access to your network from  your VPC by attaching a virtual private gateway to  the VPC, creating a custom route table, updating your s ecurity group rules, and creating an AWS managed VP N connection. Although the term VPN connection is a general term,  in the Amazon VPC documentation, a VPN connection refers to the connection between your VP C and your own network. AWS supports Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN connections. A customer gateway is a physical device or software  application on your side of the VPN connection. To create a VPN connection, you must create a custo mer gateway resource in AWS, which provides information to AWS about your customer gateway devi ce. Next, you have to set up an Internet-routable I P address (static) of the customer gateway's external  interface. The following diagram illustrates single VPN connec tions. The VPC has an attached virtual private gateway, and your remote network includes a custome r gateway, which you must configure to enable the VPN connection. You set up the routing so that any traffic from the VPC bound for your network is rout ed to the virtual private gateway. The options that say: A dedicated NAT instance in a  public subnet and the main route table in your VPC to route traffic through a NAT instance are inc orrect since you don't need a NAT instance for you to be able to create a VPN connection. An EIP to the Virtual Private Gateway is incorrect since you do not attach an EIP to a VPG.

        ],
        "correct": "C. C. Increase the write capacity assigned to the sh ard table.",
        "explanation": "Explanation A new shard iterator is returned by every GetRecord s request (as NextShardIterator), which you then us e in the next GetRecords request (as ShardIterator). Typically, this shard iterator does not expire befo re you use it. However, you may find that shard iterators expire because you have not called GetRecords for m ore than 5 minutes, or because you've performed a resta rt of your consumer application. If the shard iterator expires immediately before yo u can use it, this might indicate that the DynamoDB  table used by Kinesis does not have enough capacity to st ore the lease data. This situation is more likely t o happen if you have a large number of shards. To sol ve this problem, increase the write capacity assign ed to the shard table. Hence, increasing the write capacity assigned to th e shard table is the correct answer. Upgrading the storage capacity of the DynamoDB tabl e is incorrect because DynamoDB is a fully managed service which automatically scales its stor age, without setting it up manually. The scenario r efers to the write capacity of the shard table as it says  that the DynamoDB table used by Kinesis does not h ave enough capacity to store the lease data. Enabling In-Memory Acceleration with DynamoDB Accel erator (DAX) is incorrect because the DAX feature is primarily used for read performance impr ovement of your DynamoDB table from milliseconds response time to microseconds.

Using Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics to properly sup port the data analytics application instead of Kinesis Data Stream is incorrect. Although Amazon K inesis Data Analytics can support a data analytics application, it is still not a suitable solution fo r this issue.

If you need to support non-SNI compliant browsers for HTTPS content, it is recommended to use the Dedicated IP Custom SSL feature. Using Server Name Indication (SNI) on your Classic Load Balancer by adding multiple SSL certificates to allow multiple domains to serve SSL  traffic is incorrect because a Classic Load Balanc er does not support Server Name Indication (SNI).

Then we can improve the architecture further by integrating it with CloudFr ont. This way, users will be able to load both the web pages and images faster than if we are serving them from a standard webserver. Hence, the correct answer is: Upload the HTML, CSS,  Javascript, and the images in a single bucket. Then enable website hosting. Create a CloudFront di stribution and point the domain on the S3 website endpoint. The option that says: Create an Nginx web server in  an EC2 instance to host the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files then enable caching. Upload the im ages in a S3 bucket. Use CloudFront as a CDN to deliver the images closer to your end-users is inco rrect. Creating your own web server just to host a static website in AWS is a costly solution. Web Servers on  an EC2 instance is usually used for hosting dynami c web applications. Since static websites contain web pag es with fixed content, we should use S3 website hos ting instead. The option that says: Launch an Auto Scaling Group using an AMI that has a pre-configured Apache web server, then configure the scaling policy accor dingly. Store the images in an Elastic Block Store. Then, point your instance's endpoint to AWS Global Accelerator is incorrect. This is how we serve static websites in the old days. Now, with the help  of S3 website hosting, we can host our static cont ents from a durable, high-availability, and highly scalable env ironment without managing any servers. Hosting stat ic websites in S3 is cheaper than hosting it in an EC2  instance. In addition, Using ASG for scaling insta nces that host a static website is an over-engineered solutio n that carries unnecessary costs. S3 automatically scales to high requests and you only pay for what you use. The option that says: Create an Nginx web server in  an Amazon LightSail instance to host the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files then enable caching. Uplo ad the images in an S3 bucket. Use CloudFront as a CDN to deliver the images closer to your end-user s is incorrect because although LightSail is cheape r than EC2, creating your own LightSail web server for hos ting static websites is still a relatively expensiv e solution when compared to hosting it on S3. In addition, S3 automatically scales to high request rates.

Ideal for advance d load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic, Applicati on Load Balancer provides advanced request routing targeted at delivery of modern application architec tures, including microservices and container-based applications. Application Load Balancer simplifies and improves the security of your application, by ensuring that the latest SSL/TLS ciphers and protoc ols are used at all times. If your application is composed of several individu al services, an Application Load Balancer can route  a request to a service based on the content of the request su ch as Host field, Path URL, HTTP header, HTTP metho d, Query string, or Source IP address. Host-based Routing: You can route a client request based on the Host field of the HTTP header allowing  you to route to multiple domains from the same load balanc er. Path-based Routing: You can route a client request based on the URL path of the HTTP header. HTTP header-based routing: You can route a client r equest based on the value of any standard or custom HTTP header. HTTP method-based routing: You can route a client r equest based on any standard or custom HTTP method. Query string parameter-based routing: You can route  a client request based on query string or query parameters. Source IP address CIDR-based routing: You can route  a client request based on source IP address CIDR from where the request originates. Application Load Balancers support path-based routi ng, host-based routing, and support for containeriz ed applications hence, Application Load Balancer is th e correct answer. Network Load Balancer is incorrect. Although it can  handle WebSockets connections, it doesn't support path-based routing or host-based routing, unlike an  Application Load Balancer. Classic Load Balancer is incorrect because this typ e of load balancer is intended for applications tha t are built within the EC2-Classic network only. A CLB doesn't support path-based routing or host-based routing.

        "explanation": "Explanation Docker containers are particularly suited for batch  job workloads. Batch jobs are often short-lived an d embarrassingly parallel. You can package your batch  processing application into a Docker image so that  you can deploy it anywhere, such as in an Amazon ECS ta sk. Amazon ECS supports batch jobs. You can use Amazon ECS Run Task action to run one or more tasks once. The Run Task action starts the ECS task on an  instance that meets the task's requirements includ ing CPU, memory, and ports. For example, you can set up an ECS Batch architectu re for an image processing application. You can set  up an AWS CloudFormation template that creates an Amazon S3 bucket, an Amazon SQS queue, an Amazon CloudWatch alarm, an ECS cluster, and an ECS task d efinition. Objects uploaded to the input S3 bucket trigger an event that sends object details to the S QS queue. The ECS task deploys a Docker container t hat reads from that queue, parses the message containin g the object name and then downloads the object. On ce transformed it will upload the objects to the S3 ou tput bucket. By using the SQS queue as the location for all obje ct details, you can take advantage of its scalabili ty and reliability as the queue will automatically scale b ased on the incoming messages and message retention  can be configured. The ECS Cluster will then be able to sc ale services up or down based on the number of messages in the queue. You have to create an IAM Role that the ECS task as sumes in order to get access to the S3 buckets and SQS queue. Note that the permissions of the IAM rol e don't specify the S3 bucket ARN for the incoming bucket. This is to avoid a circular dependency issu e in the CloudFormation template. You should always make sure to assign the least amount of privileges needed to an IAM role. Hence, the correct answer is: Launch a new Amazon S QS queue and configure the second ECS task to read from it. Create an IAM role that the ECS tasks  can assume in order to get access to the S3 bucket s and SQS queue. Declare the IAM Role (taskRoleArn) i n the task definition. The option that says: Launch a new Amazon AppStream  2.0 queue and configure the second ECS task to read from it. Create an IAM role that the ECS tasks  can assume in order to get access to the S3 bucket s and AppStream 2.0 queue. Declare the IAM Role (task RoleArn) in the task definition is incorrect because Amazon AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed app lication streaming service and can't be used as a queue. You have to use Amazon SQS instead. The option that says: Launch a new Amazon Kinesis D ata Firehose and configure the second ECS task to read from it. Create an IAM role that the ECS ta sks can assume in order to get access to the S3 buckets and Kinesis Data Firehose. Specify the ARN of the IAM Role in the (taskDefinitionArn) field of the task definition is incorrect because Amazon Kin esis Data Firehose is a fully managed service for delivering real-time streaming data. Although it ca n stream data to an S3 bucket, it is not suitable t o be used as a queue for a batch application in this scenario . In addition, the ARN of the IAM Role should be declared in the taskRoleArn and not in the taskDefi nitionArn field. The option that says: Launch a new Amazon MQ queue and configure the second ECS task to read from it. Create an IAM role that the ECS tasks can assum e in order to get access to the S3 buckets and Amazon MQ queue. Set the (EnableTaskIAMRole) option  to true in the task definition is incorrect because Amazon MQ is primarily used as a managed me ssage broker service and not a queue. The EnableTaskIAMRole option is only applicable for Win dows-based ECS Tasks that require extra configuration.

With Amazon SNS, you can use topics to simultaneously distribute messages to multiple subs cribing endpoints such as Amazon SQS queues, AWS Lambda functions, HTTP endpoints, email addresses, and mobile devices (SMS, Push). Amazon SQS is a message queue service used by distr ibuted applications to exchange messages through a polling model. It can be used to decouple sending a nd receiving components without requiring each component to be concurrently available. A fanout scenario occurs when a message published t o an SNS topic is replicated and pushed to multiple endpoints, such as Amazon SQS queues, HTTP(S) endpo ints, and Lambda functions. This allows for parallel asynchronous processing. certkingdom For example, you can develop an application that pu blishes a message to an SNS topic whenever an ordercertkingdom is placed for a product. Then, two or more SQS queu es that are subscribed to the SNS topic receive certkingdom identical notifications for the new order.

Using Amazon SNS and Amazon SQS together, certkingdom messages can be delivered to applications that requ ire immediate notification of an event. This method  is certkingdom known as fanout to Amazon SQS queues. certkingdom certkingdom Hence, the correct answer is: Create one Amazon SNS  topic and configure the Amazon SQS queues to certkingdom certkingdom subscribe to the SNS topic.

By  doing so, the entire message processing will not exceed 2 4 hours. The option that says: Create multiple Amazon SNS to pics and configure the Amazon SQS queues to subscribe to the SNS topics. Publish the message to  the designated SQS queue based on the quote request type is incorrect because to implement the solution asked in the scenario, you only need to us e one Amazon SNS topic.

In the past, when you created a custom application that retrieves information from a database, you typ ically had to embed the credentials (the secret) for accessing  the database directly in the application.

Then you had to distribute the updated application.  If you had multiple applications that shared credentials and y ou missed updating one of them, the application wou ld break. Because of this risk, many customers have chosen no t to regularly rotate their credentials, which effe ctively substitutes one risk for another. Secrets Manager enables you to replace hardcoded cr edentials in your code (including passwords), with an API call to Secrets Manager to retrieve the secret prog rammatically.

        "explanation": "Explanation The best way to implement a bastion host is to crea te a small EC2 instance which should only have a security group from a particular IP address for max imum security. This will block any SSH Brute Force attacks on your bastion host. It is also recommended to use a small  instance rather than a large one because this host  will only act as a jump server to connect to other instances in your VPC and nothing else. Therefore, there is no point of allocating a large instance simply because it doesn't need that much computing power to process SSH (port 22) or RDP (po rt 3389) connections. It is possible to use SSH wit h an ordinary user ID and a pre-configured password as c redentials but it is more secure to use public key pairs for SSH authentication for better security. Hence, the right answer for this scenario is the op tion that says: Create a small EC2 instance with a security group which only allows access on port 22 via the IP address of the corporate data center. Use a private key (.pem) file to connect to the bas tion host. Creating a large EC2 instance with a security group  which only allows access on port 22 using your own pre-configured password and creating a small EC 2 instance with a security group which only allows access on port 22 using your own pre-configu red password are incorrect. Even though you have your own pre-configured password, the SSH connection can still be accessed by anyone over the Internet, which poses as a secur ity vulnerability. The option that says: Create a large EC2 instance w ith a security group which only allows access on port 22 via the IP address of the corporate data ce nter. Use a private key (.pem) file to connect to t he bastion host is incorrect because you don't need a large in stance for a bastion host as it does not require mu ch CPU resources.

        "correct": "B. B. Use Route 53 Geolocation Routing policy.",
        "explanation": "Explanation Geolocation routing lets you choose the resources t hat serve your traffic based on the geographic loca tion of your users, meaning the location that DNS querie s originate from. For example, you might want all queries from Europe to be routed to an ELB load bal ancer in the Frankfurt region. When you use geolocation routing, you can localize your content and present some or all of your websit e in the language of your users. You can also use geoloc ation routing to restrict distribution of content t o only the locations in which you have distribution rights . Another possible use is for balancing load across  endpoints in a predictable, easy-to-manage way, so that each user location is consistently routed to the same en dpoint. Setting up an Application Load Balancers that will automatically route the traffic to the proper AWS region is incorrect because Elastic Load Balancers distribute traffic among EC2 instances across multi ple Availability Zones but not across AWS regions. Setting up a new CloudFront web distribution with t he geo-restriction feature enabled is incorrect because the CloudFront geo-restriction feature is p rimarily used to prevent users in specific geograph ic locations from accessing content that you're distri buting through a CloudFront web distribution.

        "correct": "B. B. Use AWS STS",
        "explanation": "Explanation AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) is the service  that you can use to create and provide trusted users with temporary security credentials that can control access to your AWS resources. Temporary security credentials work almost identically to the  long-term access key credentials that your IAM use rs can use. In this diagram, IAM user Alice in the Dev account (the role-assuming account) needs to access the Pro d account (the role-owning account). Here's how it wo rks: Alice in the Dev account assumes an IAM role (Write Access) in the Prod account by calling AssumeRole. STS returns a set of temporary security credentials . Alice uses the temporary security credentials to ac cess services and resources in the Prod account. Al ice could, for example, make calls to Amazon S3 and Ama zon EC2, which are granted by the WriteAccess role. Using AWS Cognito to issue JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is  incorrect because the Amazon Cognito service is primarily used for user authentication a nd not for providing access to your AWS resources. A JSON Web Token (JWT) is meant to be used for user authen tication and session management. Using AWS SSO is incorrect.

CloudFront is integrated with AWS  both physical lo cations that are directly connected to the AWS glob al infrastructure, as well as other AWS services. Clou dFront works seamlessly with services including AWS Shield for DDoS mitigation, Amazon S3, Elastic Load  Balancing or Amazon EC2 as origins for your applications, and Lambda@Edge to run custom code cl oser to customers' users and to customize the user experience. Lastly, if you use AWS origins such as Amazon S3, Amazon EC2 or Elastic Load Balancing, you don't pay for any data transferred between thes e services and CloudFront. Amazon S3 is object storage built to store and retr ieve any amount of data from anywhere on the Intern et. It's a simple storage service that offers an extremely dur able, highly available, and infinitely scalable dat a storage infrastructure at very low costs. AWS Global Accelerator and Amazon CloudFront are se parate services that use the AWS global network and its edge locations around the world. CloudFront  improves performance for both cacheable content (such as images and videos) and dynamic content (su ch as API acceleration and dynamic site delivery). Global Accelerator improves performance for a wide range of applications over TCP or UDP by proxying packets at the edge to applications running in one or more AWS Regions. Global Accelerator is a good f it for non-HTTP use cases, such as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT ), or Voice over IP, as well as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses  or deterministic, fast regional failover. Both ser vices integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection. Hence, the correct options are Amazon CloudFront an d Amazon S3. AWS Fargate is incorrect because this service is ju st a serverless compute engine for containers that work with both Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) and Ama zon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). Although this service is more cost-effective than i ts server-based counterpart, Amazon S3 still costs way less than Fargate, especially for storing static content . AWS Lambda is incorrect because this simply lets yo u run your code serverless, without provisioning or managing servers. Although this is also a cost-effe ctive service since you have to pay only for the co mpute time you consume, you can't use this to store static con tent or as a Content Delivery Network (CDN). A bett er combination is Amazon CloudFront and Amazon S3. AWS Global Accelerator is incorrect because this se rvice is more suitable for non-HTTP use cases, such  as gaming (UDP), IoT (MQTT), or Voice over IP, as well  as for HTTP use cases that specifically require static IP addresses or deterministic, fast regional  failover.

IAM roles are designed so that your applications can securely  make API requests from your instances, without requiring  you to manage the security credentials that the ap plications use. Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials, you can delegate permission to make AP I requests using IAM roles. AWS Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is a simple b est practice that adds an extra layer of protection  on top of your user name and password. With MFA enabled, when  a user signs in to an AWS website, they will be prompted for their user name and password ( the first factor--what they know), as well as for a n authentication code from their AWS MFA device (the second factor--what they have). Taken together, these multiple factors provide increased security f or your AWS account settings and resources. You can  enable MFA for your AWS account and for individual IAM use rs you have created under your account. MFA can also be used to control access to AWS servi ce APIs. Storing the AWS Access Keys in the EC2 instance is incorrect. This is not recommended by AWS as it can be compromised. Instead of storing access keys on an EC2 instance for use by applications that run  on the instance and make AWS API requests, you can use an IAM role to provide temporary access keys for these applications. Assigning an IAM user for each Amazon EC2 Instance is incorrect because there is no need to create an IAM user for this scenario since IAM roles already provide greater flexibility and easier management. Storing the AWS Access Keys in ACM is incorrect bec ause ACM is just a service that lets you easily provision, manage, and deploy public and private SS L/TLS certificates for use with AWS services and yo ur internal connected resources.

You can also use them for throughp ut- intensive applications that perform continuous disk  scans. EBS volumes persist independently from the running life of an EC2 instance. Here is a list of important information about EBS V olumes: - When you create an EBS volume in an Availability Zone, it is automatically replicated within that zo ne to prevent data loss due to a failure of any single ha rdware component. - An EBS volume can only be attached to one EC2 ins tance at a time. - After you create a volume, you can attach it to a ny EC2 instance in the same Availability Zone - An EBS volume is off-instance storage that can pe rsist independently from the life of an instance.

You can use an AWS Lambda function to process messa ges in an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue. Lambda event source mappings support st andard queues and first-in, first-out (FIFO) queues . With Amazon SQS, you can offload tasks from one com ponent of your application by sending them to a queue and processing them asynchronously. Kinesis Data Streams is a real-time data streaming service that requires the provisioning of shards. A mazon SQS is a cheaper option because you only pay for wh at you use. Since there is no requirement for real- time processing in the scenario given, replacing Kinesis  Data Streams with Amazon SQS would save more costs . Hence, the correct answer is: Replace the Kinesis s tream with an Amazon SQS queue. Create a Lambda function that will asynchronously process th e requests. Using a combination of Lambda and Step Functions to  orchestrate service components and asynchronously process the requests is incorrect. T he AWS Step Functions service lets you coordinate multiple AWS services into serverless workflows so you can build and update apps quickly. Although thi s can be a valid solution, it is not cost-effective since  the application does not have a lot of components to orchestrate. Lambda functions can effectively meet the requirements in this scenario without using Ste p Functions. This service is not as cost-effective as  Lambda. Using a combination of SQS to queue the requests an d then asynchronously processing them using On-Demand EC2 Instances and Using a combination of SNS to buffer the requests and then asynchronously processing them using On-Demand EC2 Instances are both incorrect as using On- Demand EC2 instances is not cost-effective. It is b etter to use a Lambda function instead.

        "question": ": A media company hosts large volumes of archive data  that are about 250 TB in size on their internal servers. They have decided to move these data to S3  because of its durability and redundancy. The company currently has a 100 Mbps dedicated line con necting their head office to the Internet. Which of the following is the FASTEST and the MOST cost-effective way to import all these data to Amazon S3?",
        "options": [
            "A. A. Upload it directly to S3",
            "B. B. Use AWS Snowmobile to transfer the data over t o S3.",

        ],
        "correct": "D. D. Order multiple AWS Snowball devices to upload the files to Amazon S3.",
        "explanation": "Explanation AWS Snowball is a petabyte-scale data transport sol ution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of the AWS cloud. Usin g Snowball addresses common challenges with large- scale data transfers including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns. Transfe rring data with Snowball is simple, fast, secure, and can be a s little as one-fifth the cost of high-speed Intern et. Snowball is a strong choice for data transfer if yo u need to more securely and quickly transfer teraby tes to many petabytes of data to AWS. Snowball can also be  the right choice if you don't want to make expensi ve upgrades to your network infrastructure, if you fre quently experience large backlogs of data, if you'r e located in a physically isolated environment, or if you're in an area where high-speed Internet connections are n ot available or cost-prohibitive. As a rule of thumb, if it takes more than one week to upload your data to AWS using the spare capacity  of your existing Internet connection, then you should consi der using Snowball. For example, if you have a 100 Mb connection that you can solely dedicate to transfer ring your data and need to transfer 100 TB of data,  it takes more than 100 days to complete data transfer over t hat connection. You can make the same transfer by u sing multiple Snowballs in about a week. Hence, ordering multiple AWS Snowball devices to up load the files to Amazon S3 is the correct answer. Uploading it directly to S3 is incorrect since this  would take too long to finish due to the slow Inte rnet connection of the company. Establishing an AWS Direct Connect connection then transferring the data over to S3 is incorrect since provisioning a line for Direct Connect would take t oo much time and might not give you the fastest dat a transfer solution. In addition, the scenario didn't warrant an establishment of a dedicated connection from you r on- premises data center to AWS. The primary goal is to  just do a one-time migration of data to AWS which can be accomplished by using AWS Snowball devices. Using AWS Snowmobile to transfer the data over to S 3 is incorrect because Snowmobile is more suitable if you need to move extremely large amounts of data  to AWS or need to transfer up to 100PB of data. Th is will be transported on a 45-foot long ruggedized shippin g container, pulled by a semi-trailer truck. Take n ote that you only need to migrate 250 TB of data, hence, thi s is not the most suitable and cost-effective solut ion.

        "explanation": "Explanation A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect you r VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink withou t requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Insta nces in your VPC do not require public IP addresses  to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other service does not leave the Amazon network. When you create a VPC endpoint, you can attach an e ndpoint policy that controls access to the service to which you are connecting. You can modify the endpoi nt policy attached to your endpoint and add or remove the route tables used by the endpoint. An en dpoint policy does not override or replace IAM user  policies or service-specific policies (such as S3 bucket pol icies). It is a separate policy for controlling acc ess from the endpoint to the specified service. We can use a bucket policy or an endpoint policy to  allow the traffic to trusted S3 buckets. The optio ns that have 'trusted S3 buckets' key phrases will be the p ossible answer in this scenario. It would take you a lot of time to configure a bucket policy for each S3 bucket ins tead of using a single endpoint policy. Therefore, you should use an endpoint policy to control the traffic to th e trusted Amazon S3 buckets. Hence, the correct answer is: Generate an endpoint policy for trusted S3 buckets. The option that says: Generate a bucket policy for trusted S3 buckets is incorrect. Although this is a  valid solution, it takes a lot of time to set up a bucket  policy for each and every S3 bucket. This can simp ly be accomplished by creating an S3 endpoint policy. The option that says: Generate a bucket policy for trusted VPCs is incorrect because you are generatin g a policy for trusted VPCs. Remember that the scenario  only requires you to allow the traffic for trusted  S3 buckets, and not to the VPCs.

        "explanation": "Explanation Use an active-passive failover configuration when y ou want a primary resource or group of resources to  be available majority of the time and you want a secon dary resource or group of resources to be on standb y in case all the primary resources become unavailable. When responding to queries, Route 53 includes only the healthy primary resources. If all the primary resou rces are unhealthy, Route 53 begins to include only  the healthy secondary resources in response to DNS quer ies. To create an active-passive failover configuration with one primary record and one secondary record, y ou just create the records and specify Failover for the rou ting policy. When the primary resource is healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries using the primary record. W hen the primary resource is unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries using the secondar y record. You can configure a health check that monitors an e ndpoint that you specify either by IP address or by  domain name. At regular intervals that you specify, Route 53 submits automated requests over the Internet to your application, server, or other resource to verify th at it's reachable, available, and functional. Optio nally, you can configure the health check to make requests similar  to those that your users make, such as requesting a web page from a specific URL. When Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, it sends an HTTP, HTTPS, or TCP request to the IP address and port that you specified when you create d the health check. For a health check to succeed, your router and firewall rules must allow inbound traffi c from the IP addresses that the Route 53 health ch eckers use. Hence, the correct answer is: Set up a failover rou ting policy configuration in Route 53 by adding a health check on the primary service endpoint. Confi gure Route 53 to direct the DNS queries to the secondary record when the primary resource is unhea lthy. Configure the network access control list and the route table to allow Route 53 to send reque sts to the endpoints specified in the health checks . Enable the Evaluate Target Health option by setting  it to Yes. The option that says: Set up a Weighted routing pol icy configuration in Route 53 by adding health checks on both the primary stack and the DR environ ment. Configure the network access control list and the route table to allow Route 53 to send reque sts to the endpoints specified in the health checks . Enable the Evaluate Target Health option by setting  it to Yes is incorrect because Weighted routing simply lets you associate multiple resources with a  single domain name (tutorialsdojo.com) or subdomai n name (blog.tutorialsdojo.com) and choose how much traffi c is routed to each resource. This can be useful fo r a variety of purposes, including load balancing and t esting new versions of software, but not for a fail over configuration. Remember that the scenario says that  the solution should automatically route the live t raffic to the disaster recovery (DR) environment only in the event that the primary application stack experi ences an outage. This configuration is incorrectly distributing the traffic on both the primary and DR  environment. The option that says: Set up a CloudWatch Alarm to monitor the primary Route 53 DNS endpoint and create a custom Lambda function. Execute the Change ResourceRecordSets API call using the function to initiate the failover to the secondary DNS record is incorrect because setting up a CloudWatch Alarm and using the Route 53 API is not applicable nor useful at all in this scenario. Remember that CloudWatch Alam is primarily used for  monitoring CloudWatch metrics. You have to use a Failover routing policy instead. The option that says: Set up a CloudWatch Events ru le to monitor the primary Route 53 DNS endpoint and create a custom Lambda function. Execu te theChangeResourceRecordSets API call using the function to initiate the failover to the secondary DNS record is incorrect because the Amazo n CloudWatch Events service is commonly used to deliv er a near real-time stream of system events that describe changes in some Amazon Web Services (AWS) resources. There is no direct way for CloudWatch Events to monitor the status of your Route 53 endpo ints.

Manual tasks related to data transfers can slow down migrations and burden IT operations. DataSync eliminates or automatically handles many o f these tasks, including scripting copy jobs, scheduling, and monitoring transfers, validating da ta, and optimizing network utilization. The DataSyn c software agent connects to your Network File System (NFS), S erver Message Block (SMB) storage, and your self-managed object storage, so you don't have  to modify your applications. DataSync can transfer hundreds of terabytes and mil lions of files at speeds up to 10 times faster than  open- source tools, over the Internet or AWS Direct Conne ct links. You can use DataSync to migrate active da ta sets or archives to AWS, transfer data to the cloud for timely analysis and processing, or replicate data t o AWS for business continuity.

Users log on to the bastion host via SSH or RDP and then use that session to manage other hosts  in the private subnets. Deploying a Windows Bastion host on the corporate n etwork that has RDP access to all EC2 instances in the VPC is incorrect since you do not deploy the Bastion host to your corporate network. It should be in the public subnet of a VPC. Deploying a Windows Bastion host with an Elastic IP  address in the private subnet, and restricting RDP access to the bastion from only the corporate p ublic IP addresses is incorrect since it should be deployed in a public subnet, not a private subnet. Deploying a Windows Bastion host with an Elastic IP  address in the public subnet and allowing SSH access to the bastion from anywhere is incorrect. S ince it is a Windows bastion, you should allow RDP access and not SSH as this is mainly used for Linux -based systems.",

        "explanation": "Explanation AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps pr otect your web applications or APIs against common web exploits that may affect availability, compromi se security, or consume excessive resources. AWS WAF gives you control over how traffic reaches your  applications by enabling you to create security ru les that block common attack patterns, such as SQL inje ction or cross-site scripting, and rules that filte r out specific traffic patterns you define. You can deplo y AWS WAF on Amazon CloudFront as part of your CDN solution, the Application Load Balancer that fr onts your web servers or origin servers running on EC2, or Amazon API Gateway for your APIs. To detect and mitigate DDoS attacks, you can use AW S WAF in addition to AWS Shield. AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps detect and miti gate web application layer DDoS attacks by inspecti ng traffic inline. Application layer DDoS attacks use well-formed but malicious requests to evade mitigat ion and consume application resources. You can define c ustom security rules that contain a set of conditio ns, rules, and actions to block attacking traffic. Afte r you define web ACLs, you can apply them to CloudF ront distributions, and web ACLs are evaluated in the pr iority order you specified when you configured them . By using AWS WAF, you can configure web access cont rol lists (Web ACLs) on your CloudFront distributions or Application Load Balancers to filt er and block requests based on request signatures. Each Web ACL consists of rules that you can configure to str ing match or regex match one or more request attributes, such as the URI, query-string, HTTP met hod, or header key. In addition, by using AWS WAF's  rate- based rules, you can automatically block the IP add resses of bad actors when requests matching a rule exceed a threshold that you define. Requests from offendin g client IP addresses will receive 403 Forbidden er ror responses and will remain blocked until request rat es drop below the threshold. This is useful for mit igating HTTP flood attacks that are disguised as regular we b traffic. It is recommended that you add web ACLs with rate-b ased rules as part of your AWS Shield Advanced protection. These rules can alert you to sudden spi kes in traffic that might indicate a potential DDoS  event. A rate-based rule counts the requests that arrive fro m any individual address in any five-minute period.  If the number of requests exceeds the limit that you defin e, the rule can trigger an action such as sending y ou a notification. Hence, the correct answer is: Configure Amazon Clou dFront distribution and set Application Load Balancer as the origin. Create a rate-based web ACL  rule using AWS WAF and associate it with Amazon CloudFront. The option that says: Configure Amazon CloudFront d istribution and set a Network Load Balancer as the origin. Use VPC Flow Logs to monitor abnormal t raffic patterns. Set up a custom AWS Lambda function that processes the flow logs and invokes A mazon SNS for notification is incorrect because thi s option only allows you to monitor the traffic that is reac hing your instance. You can't use VPC Flow Logs to mitigate DDoS attacks. The option that says: Configure Amazon CloudFront d istribution and set an Application Load Balancer as the origin. Create a security group rul e and deny all the suspicious addresses. Use Amazon SNS for notification is incorrect. To deny s uspicious addresses, you must manually insert the I P addresses of these hosts. This is a manual task whi ch is not a sustainable solution. Take note that at tackers generate large volumes of packets or requests to ov erwhelm the target system. Using a security group i n this scenario won't help you mitigate DDoS attacks. The option that says: Configure Amazon CloudFront d istribution and set a Network Load Balancer as the origin. Use Amazon GuardDuty to block suspiciou s hosts based on its security findings. Set up a custom AWS Lambda function that processes the secur ity logs and invokes Amazon SNS for notification is incorrect because Amazon GuardDuty is just a threat detection service. You should use AWS WAF and create your own AWS WAF rate-based rule s for mitigating HTTP flood attacks that are disguised as regular web traffic.

        "correct": "B. B. Geoproximity Routing",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. You can use Route 53 to perform three main functions in any  combination: domain registration, DNS routing, and  health checking. After you create a hosted zone for your d omain, such as example.com, you create records to t ell the Domain Name System (DNS) how you want traffic to be  routed for that domain. For example, you might create records that cause DN S to do the following: Route Internet traffic for example.com to the IP ad dress of a host in your data center. Route email for that domain (jose.rizal@tutorialsdo jo.com) to a mail server (mail.tutorialsdojo.com). Route traffic for a subdomain called operations.man ila.tutorialsdojo.com to the IP address of a differ ent host. Each record includes the name of a domain or a subd omain, a record type (for example, a record with a type of MX routes email), and other information app licable to the record type (for MX records, the hostname of one or more mail servers and a priority  for each server). Route 53 has different routing policies that you ca n choose from. Below are some of the policies: Latency Routing lets Amazon Route 53 serve user req uests from the AWS Region that provides the lowest latency. It does not, however, guarantee that users  in the same geographic region will be served from the same location. Geoproximity Routing lets Amazon Route 53 route tra ffic to your resources based on the geographic location of your users and your resources. You can also optionally choose to route more traffic or les s to a given resource by specifying a value, known as a bi as. A bias expands or shrinks the size of the geogr aphic region from which traffic is routed to a resource. Geolocation Routing lets you choose the resources t hat serve your traffic based on the geographic loca tion of your users, meaning the location that DNS queries o riginate from. Weighted Routing lets you associate multiple resour ces with a single domain name (tutorialsdojo.com) o r subdomain name (subdomain.tutorialsdojo.com) and ch oose how much traffic is routed to each resource. In this scenario, the problem requires a routing po licy that will let Route 53 route traffic to the re source in the Tokyo region from a larger portion of the Philippin es and North India. You need to use Geoproximity Routing and specify a bias to control the size of the geographic region f rom which traffic is routed to your resource. The sampl e image above uses a bias of -40 in the Tokyo regio n and a bias of 1 in the Sydney Region. Setting up the bias  configuration in this manner would cause Route 53 to route traffic coming from the middle and northern part of  the Philippines, as well as the northern part of I ndia to the resource in the Tokyo Region. Hence, the correct answer is: Geoproximity Routing. Geolocation Routing is incorrect because you cannot  control the coverage size from which traffic is ro uted to your instance in Geolocation Routing. It just lets you choose the instances that will serve traffic ba sed on the location of your users. Latency Routing is incorrect because it is mainly u sed for improving performance by letting Route 53 serve user requests from the AWS Region that provid es the lowest latency. Weighted Routing is incorrect because it is used fo r routing traffic to multiple resources in proporti ons that you specify. This can be useful for load balancing and testing new versions of a software.

Snowball Edge can undertake local  processing and edge-computing workloads in addition to transferring data between your local en vironment and the AWS Cloud. Each Snowball Edge device can transport data at spe eds faster than the internet. This transport is don e by shipping the data in the appliances through a regio nal carrier. The appliances are rugged shipping containers, complete with E Ink shipping labels. Th e AWS Snowball Edge device differs from the standar d Snowball because it can bring the power of the AWS Cloud to your on-premises location, with local storage and compute functionality. Snowball Edge devices have three options for device  configurations  storage optimized, compute optimized, and with GPU. Hence, the correct answer is: AWS Snowball Edge. AWS Snowmobile is incorrect because this is an Exab yte-scale data transfer service used to move extremely large amounts of data to AWS.

        "explanation": "Explanation IP addresses enable resources in your VPC to commun icate with each other, and with resources over the Internet. Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC support the IPv 4 and IPv6 addressing protocols. By default, Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC use the IPv4 addressing protocol. When you create a VPC, you must assign it an IPv4 CIDR block (a range of priva te IPv4 addresses). Private IPv4 addresses are not reachable over the Internet. To connect to your ins tance over the Internet, or to enable communication  between your instances and other AWS services that have pub lic endpoints, you can assign a globally- unique public IPv4 address to your instance. You can optionally associate an IPv6 CIDR block wit h your VPC and subnets, and assign IPv6 addresses from that block to the resources in your VPC. IPv6 addresses are public and reachable over the Interne t. All subnets have a modifiable attribute that determ ines whether a network interface created in that su bnet is assigned a public IPv4 address and, if applicable, an IPv6 address. This includes the primary network interface (eth0) that's created for an instance whe n you launch an instance in that subnet. Regardless  of the subnet attribute, you can still override this setti ng for a specific instance during launch. By default, nondefault subnets have the IPv4 public  addressing attribute set to false, and default sub nets have this attribute set to true. An exception is a nonde fault subnet created by the Amazon EC2 launch instance wizard -- the wizard sets the attribute to  true. You can modify this attribute using the Amaz on VPC console. In this scenario, there are 5 EC2 instances that be long to the same security group that should be able  to connect to the Internet. The main route table is pr operly configured but there is a problem connecting  to one instance. Since the other four instances are workin g fine, we can assume that the security group and t he route table are correctly configured. One possible reason  for this issue is that the problematic instance do es not have a public or an EIP address. Take note as well that the four EC2 instances all b elong to a public non-default subnet. Which means t hat a new EC2 instance will not have a public IP address by default since the since IPv4 public addressing a ttribute is initially set to false. Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: The EC2 instance does not have a public IP address associated with it. The option that says: The route table is not proper ly configured to allow traffic to and from the Inte rnet through the Internet gateway is incorrect because the other  three instances, which are associated with the sam e route table and security group, do not have any issues. The option that says: The EC2 instance is running i n an Availability Zone that is not connected to an Internet gateway is incorrect because there is no r elationship between the Availability Zone and the Internet Gateway (IGW) that may have caused the iss ue.

It used  to be that CDN merely improved the delivery of content by  replicating commonly requested files (static conte nt) across a globally distributed set of caching server s. However, CDNs have become much more useful over time. For caching, a CDN will reduce the load on an appli cation origin and improve the experience of the requestor by delivering a local copy of the content  from a nearby cache edge, or Point of Presence (Po P). The application origin is off the hook for opening the connection and delivering the content directly as t he CDN takes care of the heavy lifting. The end result is that t he application origins don't need to scale to meet demands for static content. Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery networ k (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos , applications, and APIs to customers globally with l ow latency, high transfer speeds, all within a deve loper- friendly environment.

        "correct": "B. B. Associate an Elastic IP address to a Network L oad Balancer.",
        "explanation": "Explanation A Network Load Balancer functions at the fourth lay er of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. It can handle millions of requests per second. Afte r the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the default rule's target gro up. It attempts to open a TCP connection to the sel ected target on the port specified in the listener config uration. Based on the given scenario, web service clients ca n only access trusted IP addresses. To resolve this requirement, you can use the Bring Your Own IP (BYO IP) feature to use the trusted IPs as Elastic IP addresses (EIP) to a Network Load Balancer (NLB). T his way, there's no need to re-establish the whitel ists with new IP addresses. Hence, the correct answer is: Associate an Elastic IP address to a Network Load Balancer. The option that says: Associate an Elastic IP addre ss to an Application Load Balancer is incorrect because you can't assign an Elastic IP address to a n Application Load Balancer. The alternative method  you can do is assign an Elastic IP address to a Network  Load Balancer in front of the Application Load Balancer. The option that says: Create a CloudFront distribut ion whose origin points to the private IP addresses  of your web servers is incorrect because web service client s can only access trusted IP addresses. The fastest  way to resolve this requirement is to attach an Elastic IP  address to a Network Load Balancer. The option that says: Create an Alias Record in Rou te 53 which maps to the DNS name of the load balancer is incorrect. This approach won't still al low them to access the application because of trust ed IP addresses on their firewalls.

When failing over, Amazon RDS simply flips the cano nical name record (CNAME) for your DB instance to point at the standby, which is in turn promoted to become the new primary. The option that says: The IP address of the primary  DB instance is switched to the standby DB instance is incorrect since IP addresses are per su bnet, and subnets cannot span multiple AZs. The option that says: The primary database instance  will reboot is incorrect since in the event of a failure, there is no database to reboot with.

        "explanation": "Explanation Versioning in Amazon S3 is a means of keeping multi ple variants of an object in the same bucket. You c an use the S3 Versioning feature to preserve, retrieve , and restore every version of every object stored in your buckets. With versioning, you can recover more easi ly from both unintended user actions and applicatio n failures. After versioning is enabled for a bucket,  if Amazon S3 receives multiple write requests for the same object simultaneously, it stores all of those objects. Hence, the correct answer is: Create an S3 Standard  bucket with object-level versioning enabled and configure a lifecycle rule that transfers files to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 3 years. The S3 Object Lock feature allows you to store obje cts using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. In the scenario, changes to objects are allowed but th eir previous versions should be preserved and remai n retrievable. If you enable the S3 Object Lock featu re, you won't be able to upload new versions of an object. This feature is only helpful when you want to preve nt objects from being deleted or overwritten for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely. Therefore, the following options are incorrect: - Create an S3 Standard bucket and enable S3 Object  Lock in governance mode. - Create an S3 Standard bucket with S3 Object Lock in compliance mode enabled then configure a lifecycle rule that transfers files to Amazon S3 Gl acier Deep Archive after 3 years. The option that says: Create a One-Zone-IA bucket w ith object-level versioning enabled and configure a lifecycle rule that transfers files to Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive after 3 years is incorrect.

        "explanation": "Explanation One of the best practices in AWS IAM is to grant le ast privilege. When you create IAM policies, follow the standard s ecurity advice of granting least privilege--that is , granting only the permissions required to perform a task. De termine what users need to do and then craft polici es for them that let the users perform only those tasks. Therefore, using the principle of least privilege w hich means granting only the permissions required to perform a task is the correct answer. Start with a minimum set of permissions and grant a dditional permissions as necessary. Defining the ri ght set of permissions requires some understanding of the u ser's objectives. Determine what is required for th e specific task, what actions a particular service su pports, and what permissions are required in order to perform those actions. Granting all permissions to any EC2 user is incorre ct since you don't want your users to gain access t o everything and perform unnecessary actions. Doing s o is not a good security practice. Using the principle of least privilege which means granting only the least number of people with full root access is incorrect because this is not the co rrect definition of what the principle of least pri vilege is. Determining what users need to do and then craft po licies for them that let the users perform those tasks including additional administrative operation s is incorrect since there are some users who you should not give administrative access to.

        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon VPC offers you the flexibility to fully mana ge both sides of your Amazon VPC connectivity by creating a VPN connection between your remote netwo rk and a software VPN appliance running in your Amazon VPC network. This option is recommended if y ou must manage both ends of the VPN connection either for compliance purposes or for leveraging ga teway devices that are not currently supported by Amazon VPC's VPN solution. You can connect your Amazon VPC to remote networks and users using the following VPN connectivity options: AWS Site-to-Site VPN - creates an IPsec VPN connect ion between your VPC and your remote network. On the AWS side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection,  a virtual private gateway or transit gateway provi des two VPN endpoints (tunnels) for automatic failover. AWS Client VPN - a managed client-based VPN service  that provides secure TLS VPN connections between your AWS resources and on-premises networks . AWS VPN CloudHub - capable of wiring multiple AWS S ite-to-Site VPN connections together on a virtual private gateway. This is useful if you want  to enable communication between different remote networks that uses a Site-to-Site VPN connection. Third-party software VPN appliance - You can create  a VPN connection to your remote network by using an Amazon EC2 instance in your VPC that's run ning a third party software VPN appliance. 5 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam With a VPN connection, you can connect to an Amazon  VPC in the cloud the same way you connect to your branches while establishing secure and private  sessions with IP Security (IPSec) or Transport Lay er Security (TLS) tunnels. Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: It allows you to connect your AWS cloud resources t o your on-premises data center using secure and priva te sessions with IP Security (IPSec) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnels since one of the main advantages of having a VPN connection is that you will be able to connect your Amazon VPC to other re mote networks securely. The option that says: It provides a cost-effective,  hybrid connection from your VPC to your on- premises data centers which bypasses the public Int ernet is incorrect. Although it is true that a VPN provides a cost-effective, hybrid connection from y our VPC to your on-premises data centers, it certai nly does not bypass the public Internet. A VPN connecti on actually goes through the public Internet, unlik e the AWS Direct Connect connection which has a direct an d dedicated connection to your on-premises network. The option that says: It provides a networking conn ection between two VPCs which enables you to route traffic between them using private IPv4 addre sses or IPv6 addresses is incorrect because this actually describes VPC Peering and not a VPN connec tion. The option that says: It enables you to establish a  private and dedicated network connection between your network and your VPC is incorrect because this  is the advantage of an AWS Direct Connect connection and not a VPN.

        "explanation": "Explanation In this scenario, the best way to accomplish the re quirement is to simply configure the lifecycle configuration rules on the Amazon S3 bucket to purg e the transaction logs after a month. 7 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Lifecycle configuration enables you to specify the lifecycle management of objects in a bucket. The configuration is a set of one or more rules, where each rule defines an action for Amazon S3 to apply to a group of objects. These actions can be classified a s follows: Transition actions  In which you define when object s transition to another storage class. For example, you may choose to transition objects to the STANDAR D_IA (IA, for infrequent access) storage class 30 days after creation or archive objects to the GLACI ER storage class one year after creation. Expiration actions  In which you specify when the o bjects expire. Then Amazon S3 deletes the expired objects on your behalf. Hence, the correct answer is: Configure the lifecyc le configuration rules on the Amazon S3 bucket to purge the transaction logs after a month. The option that says: Add a new bucket policy on th e Amazon S3 bucket is incorrect as it does not provide a solution to any of your needs in this sce nario. You add a bucket policy to a bucket to grant  other AWS accounts or IAM users access permissions for th e bucket and the objects in it. The option that says: Create a new IAM policy for t he Amazon S3 bucket that automatically deletes the logs after a month is incorrect because IAM pol icies are primarily used to specify what actions ar e allowed or denied on your S3 buckets.

        "correct": "",
        "explanation": "Explanation Take note that the question asks about the viable m itigation techniques that are NOT suitable to preve nt Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attack that can make your website or application unavailable to  end users. To achieve this, attackers use a variety of techniques that consume network or other resources, disrupting access for legitimate end users. To protect your system from DDoS attack, you can do  the following: - Use an Amazon CloudFront service for distributing  both static and dynamic content. - Use an Application Load Balancer with Auto Scalin g groups for your EC2 instances then restrict direc t Internet traffic to your Amazon RDS database by dep loying to a private subnet. - Set up alerts in Amazon CloudWatch to look for hi gh Network In and CPU utilization metrics. Services that are available within AWS Regions, lik e Elastic Load Balancing and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), allow you to build Distributed Denial of Service resiliency and scale to handle unexpecte d volumes of traffic within a given region. Services that are available in AWS edge locations, like Amaz on CloudFront, AWS WAF, Amazon Route53, and Amazon API  Gateway, allow you to take advantage of a global network of edge locations that can provide y our application with greater fault tolerance and increased scale for managing larger volumes of traf fic. 11 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam In addition, you can also use AWS Shield and AWS WA F to fortify your cloud network. AWS Shield is a managed DDoS protection service that is available i n two tiers: Standard and Advanced. AWS Shield Standard applies always-on detection and inline mit igation techniques, such as deterministic packet filtering and priority-based traffic shaping, to mi nimize application downtime and latency. AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps pr otect web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, comprom ise security, or consume excessive resources. You c an use AWS WAF to define customizable web security rul es that control which traffic accesses your web applications. If you use AWS Shield Advanced, you c an use AWS WAF at no extra cost for those protected resources and can engage the DRT to create WAF rule s. Using Dedicated EC2 instances to ensure that each i nstance has the maximum performance possible is not a viable mitigation technique because Dedica ted EC2 instances are just an instance billing opti on. Although it may ensure that each instance gives the  maximum performance, that by itself is not enough to mitigate a DDoS attack. Adding multiple Elastic Fabric Adapters (EFA) to ea ch EC2 instance to increase the network bandwidth is also not a viable option as this is ma inly done for performance improvement, and not for DDoS attack mitigation. Moreover, you can attach on ly one EFA per EC2 instance. An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is a network device that you can atta ch to your Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High- Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning ap plications. The following options are valid mitigation techniqu es that can be used to prevent DDoS: - Use an Amazon CloudFront service for distributing  both static and dynamic content. 12 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam - Use an Application Load Balancer with Auto Scalin g groups for your EC2 instances.

You can also run othe r popular distributed frameworks such as Apache Spark , HBase, Presto, and Flink in Amazon EMR, and interact with data in other AWS data stores such as  Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB. The option that says: Amazon DynamoDB for storing a nd EC2 for analyzing the logs is incorrect because DynamoDB is a noSQL database solution of AW S. It would be inefficient to store logs in DynamoDB while using EC2 to analyze them. The option that says: Amazon EC2 with EBS volumes f or storing and analyzing the log files is incorrect certkingdom. because using EC2 with EBS would be costly, and EBS  might not provide the most durable storage for your logs, unlike S3. The option that says: Amazon S3 for storing the ELB  log files and an EC2 instance for analyzing the log files using a custom-built application is incor rect because using EC2 to analyze logs would be inefficient and expensive since you will have to pr ogram the analyzer yourself.

You can u se certkingdom. placement groups to influence the placement of a gr oup of interdependent instances to meet the needs o f your workload. Depending on the type of workload, y ou can create a placement group using one of the following placement strategies: Cluster  packs instances close together inside an A vailability Zone. This strategy enables workloads t o achieve the low-latency network performance necessa ry for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of HPC applications. certkingdom. Partition  spreads your instances across logical pa rtitions such that groups of instances in one parti tion do not share the underlying hardware with groups of in stances in different partitions. This strategy is t ypically used by large distributed and replicated workloads,  such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka. Spread  strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce corre lated failures. certkingdom. Cluster placement groups are recommended for applic ations that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput, or both.

Spread placement groups are recommended for applica tions that have a small number of critical instance s that should be kept separate from each other. Launc hing instances in a spread placement group reduces the risk of simultaneous failures that might occur when  instances share the same racks. Spread placement groups provide access to distinct racks, and are th erefore suitable for mixing instance types or launc hing instances over time.

You can have a maximum of seven running instances p er Availability Zone per group. certkingdom. certkingdom. 22 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Hence, the correct answer is: Set up a cluster plac ement group within a single Availability Zone in th e same AWS Region. certkingdom. The option that says: Set up a spread placement gro up across multiple Availability Zones in multiple AWS Regions is incorrect because although using a p lacement group is valid for this particular scenari o, you can only set up a placement group in a single A WS Region only. A spread placement group can span multiple Availability Zones in the same Region. The option that says: Set up AWS Direct Connect con nections across multiple Availability Zones for increased bandwidth throughput and more consistent network experience is incorrect because this is certkingdom. primarily used for hybrid architectures.

The  pre-signed URLs are useful if you want your user/customer to be able to upload a specific objec t to your bucket, but you don't require them to hav e AWS security credentials or permissions. You can generate a pre-signed URL programmatically using the AWS SDK for Java or the AWS SDK for .NET. If you are using Microsoft Visual Studio,  you can also use AWS Explorer to generate a pre- signed object URL without writing any code. Anyone who receives a valid pre-signed URL can then programmatically upload an object. certkingdom.

        ],
        "correct": "",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performan ce and durability for database (DB) instances. This feature makes it easy to elastically scale out  beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB ins tance for read-heavy database workloads. You can create one or more replicas of a given sour ce DB Instance and serve high-volume application re ad traffic from multiple copies of your data, thereby increasing aggregate read throughput. Read replicas  can also be promoted when needed to become standalone D B instances. For the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle data base engines, Amazon RDS creates a second DB instance using a snapshot of the source DB instance . It then uses the engines' native asynchronous replication to update the read replica whenever the re is a change to the source DB instance. The read replica operates as a DB instance that allows only read-only connections; applications can connect to a read replica just as they would to any DB instance. Amaz on RDS replicates all databases in the source DB instance. 43 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam When you create a read replica for Amazon RDS for M ySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, Amazon RDS sets up a secure communications channel using p ublic-key encryption between the source DB instance and the read replica, even when replicatin g across regions. Amazon RDS establishes any AWS security configurations such as adding security gro up entries needed to enable the secure channel. You can also create read replicas within a Region o r between Regions for your Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Oracle database instances encrypted at rest with AWS Key Management Service (KMS). Hence, the correct answers are: - It elastically scales out beyond the capacity con straints of a single DB instance for read-heavy dat abase workloads. - Provides asynchronous replication and improves th e performance of the primary database by taking read-heavy database workloads from it. The option that says: Allows both read and write op erations on the read replica to complement the primary database is incorrect as Read Replicas are primarily used to offload read-only operations from  the primary database instance. By default, you can't do  a write operation to your Read Replica. 44 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam The option that says: Provides synchronous replicat ion and automatic failover in the case of Availabil ity Zone service failures is incorrect as this is a ben efit of Multi-AZ and not of a Read Replica. Moreove r, Read Replicas provide an asynchronous type of repli cation and not synchronous replication. The option that says: It enhances the read performa nce of your primary database by increasing its IOPS and accelerates its query processing via AWS Global  Accelerator is incorrect because Read Replicas do not do anything to upgrade or increase the read thr oughput on the primary DB instance per se, but it provides a way for your application to fetch data f rom replicas. In this way, it improves the overall performance of your entire database-tier (and not j ust the primary DB instance). It doesn't increase t he IOPS nor use AWS Global Accelerator to accelerate t he compute capacity of your primary database. AWS Global Accelerator is a networking service, not rel ated to RDS, that direct user traffic to the neares t application endpoint to the client, thus reducing i nternet latency and jitter. It simply routes the tr affic to the closest edge location via Anycast.

In this way, if one availability zone goes down, there is still another  available zone that can accommodate traffic. 46 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam When the first AZ goes down, the second AZ will onl y have an initial 4 EC2 instances. This will eventu ally be scaled up to 8 instances since the solution is u sing Auto Scaling. The 110% compute capacity for the 4 servers might c ause some degradation of the service, but not a tot al outage since there are still some instances that ha ndle the requests. Depending on your scale-up configuration in your Auto Scaling group, the addit ional 4 EC2 instances can be launched in a matter o f minutes. T3 instances also have a Burstable Performance capa bility to burst or go beyond the current compute capacity of the instance to higher performance as r equired by your workload. So your 4 servers will be  able to manage 110% compute capacity for a short period of time. This is the power of cloud computing versu s our on-premises network architecture.

You can launch an EB S-backed EC2 instance and attach several Instance S tore volumes but remember that there are some EC2 Instan ce types that don't support this kind of set up. 57 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Hence, the correct answers are: - The underlying host for the instance is possibly changed. - All data on the attached instance-store devices w ill be lost. The option that says: The ENI (Elastic Network Inte rface) is detached is incorrect because the ENI wil l stay attached even if you stopped your EC2 instance . The option that says: The Elastic IP address is dis associated with the instance is incorrect because t he EIP will actually remain associated with your insta nce even after stopping it. The option that says: There will be no changes is i ncorrect because there will be a lot of possible ch anges in your EC2 instance once you stop and start it aga in. AWS may move the virtualized EC2 instance to another host computer; the instance may get a new p ublic IP address, and the data in your attached ins tance store volumes will be deleted.

        "correct": "A. A. Create a Kinesis Data Stream and use AWS Lambd a to read records from the data stream.",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Kinesis Data Streams (KDS) is a massively sc alable and durable real-time data streaming service. KDS can continuously capture gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sourc es. You can use an AWS Lambda function to process recor ds in Amazon KDS. By default, Lambda invokes your function as soon as records are available in t he stream. Lambda can process up to 10 batches in e ach shard simultaneously. If you increase the number of  concurrent batches per shard, Lambda still ensures  in- order processing at the partition-key level. 59 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam The first time you invoke your function, AWS Lambda  creates an instance of the function and runs its handler method to process the event. When the funct ion returns a response, it stays active and waits t o process additional events. If you invoke the functi on again while the first event is being processed, Lambda initializes another instance, and the function proc esses the two events concurrently. As more events c ome in, Lambda routes them to available instances and c reates new instances as needed. When the number of requests decreases, Lambda stops unused instances t o free upscaling capacity for other functions. Since the media company needs a real-time analytics  service, you can use Kinesis Data Streams to gain insights from your data. The data collected is avai lable in milliseconds. Use AWS Lambda to read recor ds in batches and invoke your function to process records from the ba tch. If the batch that Lambda reads from the stream only has one record in it, Lambda sends only one re cord to the function. Hence, the correct answer in this scenario is: Crea te a Kinesis Data Stream and use AWS Lambda to read records from the data stream. The option that says: Create a Kinesis Data Firehos e and use AWS Lambda to read records from the data stream is incorrect. Although Amazon Kinesis D ata Firehose captures and loads data in near real- time, AWS Lambda can't be set as its destination. Y ou can write Lambda functions and integrate it with Kinesis Data Firehose to request additional, custom ized processing of the data before it is sent downs tream. However, this integration is primarily used for str eam processing and not the actual consumption of th e data stream. You have to use a Kinesis Data Stream in this scenario. The options that say: Create an Amazon S3 bucket to  store the captured data and use Amazon Athena to analyze the data and Create an Amazon S3 bucket to store the captured data and use Amazon Redshift Spectrum to analyze the data are both inco rrect. As per the scenario, the company needs a rea l- 60 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam time analytics service that can ingest and process data.

        "explanation": "Explanation You require an instance that will be used not as a primary server but as a spare compute resource to augment the transcoding process of your application . These instances should also be terminated once th e backlog has been significantly reduced. In addition , the scenario mentions that if the current process  is interrupted, the video can be transcoded by another  instance based on the queuing system. This means t hat the application can gracefully handle an unexpected  termination of an EC2 instance, like in the event of a Spot instance termination 61 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam when the Spot price is greater than your set maximu m price. Hence, an Amazon EC2 Spot instance is the best and cost-effective option for this scenario. Amazon EC2 Spot instances are spare compute capacit y in the AWS cloud available to you at steep discounts compared to On-Demand prices. EC2 Spot en ables you to optimize your costs on the AWS cloud and scale your application's throughput up to 10X f or the same budget. By simply selecting Spot when launching EC2 instances, you can save up-to 90% on On-Demand prices. The only difference between On- Demand instances and Spot Instances is that Spot in stances can be interrupted by EC2 with two minutes of notification when the EC2 needs the capacity back. You can specify whether Amazon EC2 should hibernate , stop, or terminate Spot Instances when they are interrupted. You can choose the interruption behavi or that meets your needs. Take note that there is no \"bid price\" anymore for Spot EC2 instances since March 2018. You simply hav e to set your maximum price instead. Reserved instances and Dedicated instances are inco rrect as both do not act as spare compute capacity. On-demand instances is a valid option but a Spot in stance is much cheaper than On-Demand.

When you create an S3 VPC  endpoint, you can attach an endpoint policy to it that controls access to Amazon S3. You can use two types of VPC endpoints to access Am azon S3: gateway endpoints and interface endpoints. A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you  specify in your route table to access Amazon S3 fr om your VPC over the AWS network. Interface endpoints extend the functionality of gateway endpoints by using private IP addresses to route requests to Ama zon S3 from within your VPC, on-premises, or from a different AWS Region.

Building applicati ons from individual components that each perform a disc rete function improves scalability and reliability,  and is best practice design for modern applications. SQ S makes it simple and cost-effective to decouple an d certkingdom. coordinate the components of a cloud application. U sing SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be always available. certkingdom. 71 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam The number of messages in your Amazon SQS queue doe s not solely define the number of instances needed. In fact, the number of instances in the fle et can be driven by multiple factors, including how  long it takes to process a message and the acceptable amoun t of latency (queue delay). The solution is to use a backlog per instance metri c with the target value being the acceptable backlo g per instance to maintain. You can calculate these numbe rs as follows: Backlog per instance: To determine your backlog per  instance, start with the Amazon SQS metric ApproximateNumberOfMessages to determine the length  of the SQS queue (number of messages available for retrieval from the queue). Divide that number b y the fleet's running capacity, which for an Auto S caling group is the number of instances in the InService s tate, to get the backlog per instance. 72 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Acceptable backlog per instance: To determine your target value, first calculate what your application  can accept in terms of latency. Then, take the acceptab le latency value and divide it by the average time that an EC2 instance takes to process a message. To illustrate with an example, let's say that the c urrent ApproximateNumberOfMessages is 1500 and the fleet's running capacity is 10. If the average proc essing time is 0.1 seconds for each message and the longest acceptable latency is 10 seconds then the a cceptable backlog per instance is 10 / 0.1, which e quals 100. This means that 100 is the target value for your target tracking policy. Because the backlog per instance i s currently at 150 (1500 / 10), your fleet scales out  by five instances to maintain proportion to the ta rget value. Hence, the correct answer is: Use an Amazon SQS que ue to decouple the application components and certkingdom. scale-out the EC2 instances based upon the Approxim ateNumberOfMessages metric in Amazon certkingdom. CloudWatch. Replacing the Auto Scaling group with a cluster pla cement group to achieve a low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-n ode communication is incorrect because although it is true that a cluster placement group allows you t o achieve a low-latency network performance, you st ill need to use Auto Scaling for your architecture to a dd more EC2 instances. certkingdom. certkingdom. Using larger instances for your application with an  attached Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is incorrectbecause using a larger EC2 instance would not preve nt data from being lost in case of a larger spike. You can take advantage of the durability and elasticity  of SQS to keep the messages available for consumpt ion by your instances. Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is simply a network interface for Amazon EC2 instances that enables customers to run applications requirin g high levels of inter-node communications at scale  on AWS. certkingdom. certkingdom. Setting up Amazon Aurora Serverless for on-demand, auto-scaling configuration of your EC2 Instances and also enabling Amazon Aurora Parallel Query feat ure for faster analytical queries over your current data is incorrect because although the Amazon Auror a Parallel Query feature provides faster analytical queries over your current data, Amazon Aurora Serve rless is an on-demand, auto-scaling configuration f or your database, and NOT for your EC2 instances.

Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam AWS Transit Gateway provides a hub and spoke design  for connecting VPCs and on-premises networks. You can attach all your hybrid connectivity (VPN an d Direct Connect connections) to a single Transit Gateway consolidating and controlling your organiza tion's entire AWS routing configuration in one plac e. It also controls how traffic is routed among all th e connected spoke networks using route tables. This  hub and spoke model simplifies management and reduces o perational costs because VPCs only connect to the Transit Gateway to gain access to the connected net works. By attaching a transit gateway to a Direct Connect gateway using a transit virtual interface, you can manage a single connection for multiple VPCs or VPN s that are in the same AWS Region. You can also advertise prefixes from on-premises to AWS and from  AWS to on-premises. The AWS Transit Gateway and AWS Direct Connect solu tion simplify the management of connections between an Amazon VPC and your networks over a priv ate connection. It can also minimize network costs, improve bandwidth throughput, and provide a more re liable network experience than Internet-based connections. Hence, the correct answer is: Create a new Direct C onnect gateway and integrate it with the existing Direct Connect connection. Set up a Transit Gateway  between AWS accounts and associate it with the Direct Connect gateway. The option that says: Set up another Direct Connect  connection for each and every new AWS account that will be added is incorrect because this soluti on entails a significant amount of additional cost.  Setting up a single DX connection requires a substantial bu dget and takes a lot of time to establish.

        "explanation": "Explanation The Amazon S3 notification feature enables you to r eceive notifications when certain events happen in your bucket. To enable notifications, you must firs t add a notification configuration that identifies the events you want Amazon S3 to publish and the destin ations where you want Amazon S3 to send the notifications. You store this configuration in the notification subresource that is associated with a bucket. Amazon S3 provides an API for you to manage this su bresource. Amazon S3 event notifications typically deliver eve nts in seconds but can sometimes take a minute or longer. If two writes are made to a single non-vers ioned object at the same time, it is possible that only a single event notification will be sent. If you want  to ensure that an event notification is sent for e very successful write, you can enable versioning on your  bucket. With versioning, every successful write wi ll create a new version of your object and will also s end an event notification. 81 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Amazon S3 can publish notifications for the followi ng events: 1.

Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic 2. Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue 3. AWS Lambda If your notification ends up writing to the bucket that triggers the notification, this could cause an  execution loop. For example, if the bucket triggers a Lambda function each time an object is uploaded and the function uploads an object to the bucket, then the function indirectly triggers itself. To avoid this,  use two buckets, or configure the trigger to only apply to a prefix used for incoming objects. Hence, the correct answers is: Create a new Amazon SNS topic and Amazon SQS queue. Add an S3 event notification configuration on the bucket to p ublish s3:ObjectCreated:* and s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete event types to SQS and SNS.

There is no s3:ObjectAdde d:* type in Amazon S3. You should add an S3 event notification configuration on the bucket to publish  events of the s3:ObjectCreated:* type instead. Mor eover, Amazon S3 does support Amazon MQ as a destination t o publish events. The option that says: Create a new Amazon SNS topic  and Amazon SQS queue. Add an S3 event notification configuration on the bucket to publish  s3:ObjectCreated:* and ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated event types to SQ S and SNS is incorrect because the s3:ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated type is only t riggered when a delete marker is created for a versioned object and not wh en an object is deleted or a versioned object is permanently deleted. The option that says: Create a new Amazon SNS topic  and Amazon MQ. Add an S3 event notification configuration on the bucket to publish s3:ObjectCre ated:* and ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated event types to SQ S and SNS is incorrect because Amazon S3 does public event messages to Amazon MQ.

Kinesis Data Streams provides an ordering of records, as well as the ability to read and/or repl ay records in the same order to multiple Amazon Kin esis Applications. The Amazon Kinesis Client Library (KC L) delivers all records for a given partition key t o the same record processor, making it easier to build mu ltiple applications reading from the same Amazon Kinesis data stream (for example, to perform counti ng, aggregation, and filtering). Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is differe nt from Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose. SQS offers a reliable, highly scalable hosted queue for  storing messages as they travel between computers. Amazon SQS lets you easily move data between distri buted application components and helps you build applications in which messages are processed indepe ndently (with message-level ack/fail semantics), su ch as automated workflows. Amazon Kinesis Data Firehos e is primarily used to load streaming data into dat a stores and analytics tools. Hence, the correct answer is: Amazon Kinesis Data F irehose. Amazon Kinesis is incorrect because this is the str eaming data platform of AWS and has four distinct services under it: Kinesis Data Firehose, Kinesis D ata Streams, Kinesis Video Streams, and Amazon Kinesis Data Analytics. For the specific use case j ust as asked in the scenario, use Kinesis Data Fire hose. Amazon Redshift is incorrect because this is mainly  used for data warehousing making it simple and cos t- effective to analyze your data across your data war ehouse and data lake.

            "D. D. Your VPC does not have sufficient subnet ENIs or subnet IPs."
        ],
        "correct": "",
        "explanation": "Explanation You can configure a function to connect to a virtua l private cloud (VPC) in your account. Use Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) to create a priv ate network for resources such as databases, cache instances, or internal services. Connect your funct ion to the VPC to access private resources during execution. AWS Lambda runs your function code securely within a VPC by default. However, to enable your Lambda function to access resources inside your private VP C, you must provide additional VPC-specific configuration information that includes VPC subnet IDs and security group IDs. AWS Lambda uses this information to set up elastic network interfaces (E NIs) that enable your function to connect securely to other resources within your private VPC. Lambda functions cannot connect directly to a VPC w ith dedicated instance tenancy. To connect to resources in a dedicated VPC, peer it to a second V PC with default tenancy. Your Lambda function automatically scales based on the number of events it processes. If your Lambda function accesses a VPC, you must make sure that yo ur VPC has sufficient ENI capacity to support the scale requirements of your Lambda function. It is a lso recommended that you specify at least one subne t in each Availability Zone in your Lambda function conf iguration. By specifying subnets in each of the Availability Z ones, your Lambda function can run in another Availability Zone if one goes down or runs out of I P addresses. If your VPC does not have sufficient E NIs or subnet IPs, your Lambda function will not scale as requests increase, and you will see an increase in 87 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam invocation errors with EC2 error types like EC2Thro ttledException. For asynchronous invocation, if you see an increase in errors without corresponding Clo udWatch Logs, invoke the Lambda function synchronously in the console to get the error respo nses. Hence, the correct answers for this scenario are: - You only specified one subnet in your Lambda func tion configuration. That single subnet runs out of available IP addresses and there is no other sub net or Availability Zone which can handle the peak load. - Your VPC does not have sufficient subnet ENIs or subnet IPs. 88 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam The option that says: Your VPC does not have a NAT gateway is incorrect because an issue in the NAT Gateway is unlikely to cause a request throttling i ssue or produce an EC2ThrottledException error in Lambda. As per the scenario, the issue is happening  only at certain times of the day, which means that  the issue is only intermittent and the function works a t other times. We can also conclude that an availab ility issue is not an issue since the application is alre ady using a highly available NAT Gateway and not ju st a NAT instance. 89 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam The option that says: The associated security group  of your function does not allow outbound connections is incorrect because if the associated security group does not allow outbound connections then the Lambda function will not work at all in the fir st place. Remember that as per the scenario, the is sue only happens intermittently. In addition, Internet traffic restrictions do not usually produce EC2ThrottledException errors. The option that says: The attached IAM execution ro le of your function does not have the necessary permissions to access the resources of your VPC is incorrect because just as what is explained above, the issue is intermittent and thus, the IAM execution r ole of the function does have the necessary permiss ions to access the resources of the VPC since it works a t those specific times. In case the issue is indeed  caused by a permission problem then an EC2AccessDeniedExce ption the error would most likely be returned and not an EC2ThrottledException error.

It is expected that the database read queries wil l significantly increase in the coming weeks ahead. A  Solutions Architect recently launched two Read Replicas to the database cluster to improve the pla tform's scalability.

        "options": [

        ],
        "correct": "A. A. Use the built-in Reader endpoint of the Amazon  Aurora database.",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Aurora typically involves a cluster of DB in stances instead of a single instance. Each connecti on is handled by a specific DB instance. When you conn ect to an Aurora cluster, the hostname and port tha t you specify point to an intermediate handler called  an endpoint. Aurora uses the endpoint mechanism to abstract these connections. Thus, you don't have to  hardcode all the hostnames or write your own logic  for load-balancing and rerouting connections when some DB instances aren't available. For certain Aurora tasks, different instances or gr oups of instances perform different roles. For exam ple, the primary instance handles all data definition la nguage (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas handle read-on ly query traffic. Using endpoints, you can map each connection to the  appropriate instance or group of instances based o n your use case. For example, to perform DDL statemen ts you can connect to whichever instance is the primary instance. To perform queries, you can conne ct to the reader endpoint, with Aurora automaticall y performing load-balancing among all the Aurora Repl icas. For clusters with DB instances of different capacities or configurations, you can connect to cu stom endpoints associated with different subsets of  DB instances. For diagnosis or tuning, you can connect  to a specific instance endpoint to examine details  about a specific DB instance. A reader endpoint for an Aurora DB cluster provides  load-balancing support for read-only connections t o the DB cluster. Use the reader endpoint for read op erations, such as queries. By processing those stat ements on the read-only Aurora Replicas, this endpoint red uces the overhead on the primary instance. It also helps the cluster to scale the capacity to handle simulta neous SELECT queries, proportional to the number of Aurora Replicas in the cluster. Each Aurora DB clus ter has one reader endpoint. If the cluster contains one or more Aurora Replicas , the reader endpoint load-balances each connection request among the Aurora Replicas. In that case, yo u can only perform read-only statements such as 91 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam SELECT in that session. If the cluster only contain s a primary instance and no Aurora Replicas, the re ader endpoint connects to the primary instance. In that case, you can perform write operations through the endpoint. Hence, the correct answer is to use the built-in Re ader endpoint of the Amazon Aurora database. The option that says: Use the built-in Cluster endp oint of the Amazon Aurora database is incorrect because a cluster endpoint (also known as a writer endpoint) simply connects to the current primary DB instance for that DB cluster. This endpoint can per form write operations in the database such as DDL statements, which is perfect for handling productio n traffic but not suitable for handling queries for reporting since there will be no write database ope rations that will be sent. The option that says: Enable Amazon Aurora Parallel  Query is incorrect because this feature simply enables Amazon Aurora to push down and distribute t he computational load of a single query across thousands of CPUs in Aurora's storage layer. Take n ote that it does not load balance all of the incomi ng read requests equally to the two Read Replicas. Wit h Parallel Query, query processing is pushed down t o the Aurora storage layer. The query gains a large a mount of computing power, and it needs to transfer far less data over the network. In the meantime, the Au rora database instance can continue serving transac tions with much less interruption. This way, you can run transactional and analytical workloads alongside ea ch other in the same Aurora database, while maintainin g high performance. The option that says: Create a new Network Load Bal ancer to evenly distribute the read queries to the Read Replicas of the Amazon Aurora database is inco rrect because a Network Load Balancer is not the suitable service/component to use for this requirem ent since an NLB is primarily used to distribute tr affic to servers, not Read Replicas.

        ],
        "correct": "",
        "explanation": "Explanation By default, an S3 object is owned by the account th at uploaded the object. That's why granting the destination account the permissions to perform the cross-account copy makes sure that the destination owns the copied objects. You can also change the ownersh ip of an object by changing its access control list  (ACL) to bucket-owner-full-control. However, object ACLs can be difficult to manage for  multiple objects, so it's a best practice to grant programmatic cross-account permissions to the desti nation account. Object ownership is important for managing permissions using a bucket policy. For a b ucket policy to apply to an object in the bucket, t he object must be owned by the account that owns the b ucket. You can also manage object permissions using the object's ACL. However, object ACLs can be diffi cult to manage for multiple objects, so it's best practice to use the bucket policy as a centralized method for setting permissions. 93 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam To be sure that a destination account owns an S3 ob ject copied from another account, grant the destina tion account the permissions to perform the cross-accoun t copy. Follow these steps to configure cross-accou nt permissions to copy objects from a source bucket in  Account A to a destination bucket in Account B: - Attach a bucket policy to the source bucket in Ac count A. - Attach an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM ) policy to a user or role in Account B. - Use the IAM user or role in Account B to perform the cross-account copy. Hence, the correct answer is: Configure cross-accou nt permissions in S3 by creating an IAM customer- managed policy that allows an IAM user or role to c opy objects from the source bucket in one account to the destination bucket in the other acco unt. Then attach the policy to the IAM user or role that you want to use to copy objects between accoun ts. The option that says: Enable the Requester Pays fea ture in the source S3 bucket. The fees would be waived through Consolidated Billing since both AWS accounts are part of AWS Organizations is incorrect because the Requester Pays feature is pri marily used if you want the requester, instead of t he bucket owner, to pay the cost of the data transfer request and download from the S3 bucket. This solut ion 94 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam lacks the necessary IAM Permissions to satisfy the requirement. The most suitable solution here is to configure cross-account permissions in S3. The option that says: Set up cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) in S3 by creating a bucket policy that allows an IAM user or role to copy objects fro m the source bucket in one account to the destination bucket in the other account is incorrec t because CORS simply defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one domain to inter act with resources in a different domain, and not o n a different AWS account. The option that says: Connect the two S3 buckets fr om two different AWS accounts to Amazon WorkDocs. Set up cross-account access to integrate the two S3 buckets. Use the Amazon WorkDocs console to copy the objects from one account to the  other with modified object ownership assigned to the destination account is incorrect because Amazon  WorkDocs is commonly used to easily collaborate, share content, provide rich feedback, and collabora tively edit documents with other users. There is no direct way for you to integrate WorkDocs and an Ama zon S3 bucket owned by a different AWS account. A better solution here is to use cross-account permis sions in S3 to meet the requirement.

Their application uploads the user files, which c an have a max file size of 1 TB, to an S3 Bucket. In this scenario, what is the best way for the appl ication to upload the large files in S3?",

            "A. A. Use Multipart Upload",
            "B. B. Use a single PUT request to upload the large f ile",

            "D. D. Use AWS Snowball"
        ],
        "correct": "A. A. Use Multipart Upload",
        "explanation": "Explanation The total volume of data and number of objects you can store are unlimited. Individual Amazon S3 objec ts can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a ma ximum of 5 terabytes. The largest object that can b e uploaded in a single PUT is 5 gigabytes. For object s larger than 100 megabytes, customers should consi der using the Multipart Upload capability. The Multipart upload API enables you to upload larg e objects in parts. You can use this API to upload new large objects or make a copy of an existing object.  Multipart uploading is a three-step process: you i nitiate the upload, you upload the object parts, and after you have uploaded all the parts, you complete the multipart upload. Upon receiving the complete multi part upload request, Amazon S3 constructs the objec t from the uploaded parts and you can then access the  object just as you would any other object in your bucket. Using a single PUT request to upload the large file  is incorrect because the largest file size you can upload using a single PUT request is 5 GB. Files la rger than this will fail to be uploaded. Using AWS Snowball is incorrect because this is a m igration tool that lets you transfer large amounts of data from your on-premises data center to AWS S3 an d vice versa. This tool is not suitable for the giv en scenario. And when you provision Snowball, the devi ce gets transported to you, and not to your custome rs. Therefore, you bear the responsibility of securing the device. Using AWS Import/Export is incorrect because Import /Export is similar to AWS Snowball in such a way that it is meant to be used as a migration tool, an d not for multiple customer consumption such as in the given scenario.

        "correct": "B. B. Request an Import Job to Amazon S3 using a Sno wball device in the AWS Snowball",
        "explanation": "Explanation AWS Snowball uses secure, rugged devices so you can  bring AWS computing and storage capabilities to your edge environments, and transfer data into and out of AWS. The service delivers you Snowball Edge devices with storage and optional Amazon EC2 and AW S IOT Greengrass compute in shippable, hardened, secure cases. With AWS Snowball, you bring cloud ca pabilities for machine learning, data analytics, processing, and storage to your edge for migrations , short-term data collection, or even long-term deployments. AWS Snowball devices work with or with out the internet, do not require a dedicated IT operator, and are designed to be used in remote env ironments. Hence, the correct answer is: Request an Import Job  to Amazon S3 using a Snowball device in the AWS Snowball Console. The option that says: Deploy an AWS Migration Hub D iscovery agent in the on-premises data center is incorrect. The AWS Migration Hub service is just  a central service that provides a single location to track the progress of application migrations across multi ple AWS and partner solutions. The option that says: Enable Amazon S3 Transfer Acc eleration on the target S3 bucket is incorrect because this S3 feature is not suitable for large-s cale data migration. Enabling this feature won't al ways guarantee faster data transfer as it's only benefic ial for long-distance transfer to and from your Ama zon S3 buckets. The option that says: Integrate AWS Storage Gateway  File Gateway with the on-premises data center is incorrect because this service is mostly used fo r building hybrid cloud solutions where you still n eed on- premises access to unlimited cloud storage.

        "correct": "C. C. EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)",
        "explanation": "Explanation The scenario requires a storage type for a relation al database with a high IOPS performance. For these scenarios, SSD volumes are more suitable to use ins tead of HDD volumes. Remember that the dominant performance attribute of SSD is IOPS while HDD is T hroughput. In the exam, always consider the difference between  SSD and HDD as shown on the table below. This will allow you to easily eliminate specific EBS-types in  the options which are not SSD or not HDD, dependin g on whether the question asks for a storage type whi ch has small, random I/O operations or large, sequential I/O operations. 98 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Since the requirement is 30,000 IOPS, you have to u se an EBS type of Provisioned IOPS SSD. This provides sustained performance for mission-critical  low-latency workloads. Hence, EBS Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) is the correct answer. EBS Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) and EBS Cold HDD  (sc1) are incorrect because these are HDD volumes which are more suitable for large streaming  workloads rather than transactional database workloads. EBS General Purpose SSD (gp2) is incorrect because although a General Purpose SSD volume can be used for this scenario, it does not provide the hig h IOPS required by the application, unlike the Prov isioned IOPS SSD volume.

        ],
        "correct": "D. D. Create an AWS Backup plan to take daily snapsh ots with a retention period of 90 days.",
        "explanation": "Explanation AWS Backup is a centralized backup service that mak es it easy and cost-effective for you to backup you r application data across AWS services in the AWS Clo ud, helping you meet your business and regulatory backup compliance requirements. AWS Backup makes pr otecting your AWS storage volumes, databases, and file systems simple by providing a central plac e where you can configure and audit the AWS resourc es you want to backup, automate backup scheduling, set  retention policies, and monitor all recent backup and restore activity. 100 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam In this scenario, you can use AWS Backup to create a backup plan with a retention period of 90 days. A backup plan is a policy expression that defines whe n and how you want to back up your AWS resources. You assign resources to backup plans, and AWS Backu p then automatically backs up and retains backups for those resources according to the backup plan. Hence, the correct answer is: Create an AWS Backup plan to take daily snapshots with a retention period of 90 days. The option that says: Configure an automated backup  and set the backup retention period to 90 days is incorrect because the maximum backup retention p eriod for automated backup is only 35 days. The option that says: Configure RDS to export the a utomated snapshot automatically to Amazon S3 and create a lifecycle policy to delete the object after 90 days is incorrect because you can't export  an automated snapshot automatically to Amazon S3. You must export the snapshot manually. The option that says: Create a daily scheduled even t using CloudWatch Events and AWS Lambda to directly download the RDS automated snapshot to an S3 bucket. Archive snapshots older than 90 days to Glacier is incorrect because you cannot directly download or e xport an automated snapshot in RDS to Amazon S3. You have to copy the automated snapshot first for i t to become a manual snapshot, which you can move t o an Amazon S3 bucket. A better solution for this sce nario is to simply use AWS Backup.

        ],
        "correct": "C. C. Configure a CreationPolicy attribute to the in stance in the CloudFormation template. Send",
        "explanation": "Explanation You can associate the CreationPolicy attribute with  a resource to prevent its status from reaching cre ate complete until AWS CloudFormation receives a specif ied number of success signals or the timeout period is exceeded. To signal a resource, you can use the cfn-signal helper script or SignalResource API. AWS CloudFormation publishes valid signals to the stack  events so that you track the number of signals sen t. The creation policy is invoked only when AWS CloudF ormation creates the associated resource. Currently , the only AWS CloudFormation resources that support creation policies are AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup, AWS::EC2::Insta nce, and AWS::CloudFormation::WaitCondition. 102 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Use the CreationPolicy attribute when you want to w ait on resource configuration actions before stack creation proceeds. For example, if you install and configure software applications on an EC2 instance,  you might want those applications to be running before proceeding. In such cases, you can add a CreationPo licy attribute to the instance, and then send a success signal to the instance after the applications are i nstalled and configured. Hence, the option that says: Configure a CreationPo licy attribute to the instance in the CloudFormation template. Send a success signal afte r the applications are installed and configured using the cfn-signal helper script is correct. The option that says: Configure the DependsOn attri bute in the CloudFormation template. Send a success signal after the applications are installed  and configured using the cfn-init helper script is incorrect because the cfn-init helper script is not  suitable to be used to signal another resource. Yo u have to use cfn-signal instead. And although you can use th e DependsOn attribute to ensure the creation of a specific resource follows another, it is still bett er to use the CreationPolicy attribute instead as i t ensures that the applications are properly running before t he stack creation proceeds. The option that says: Configure a UpdatePolicy attr ibute to the instance in the CloudFormation template. Send a success signal after the applicati ons are installed and configured using the cfn-sign al helper script is incorrect because the UpdatePolicy  attribute is primarily used for updating resources  and for stack update rollback operations. The option that says: Configure the UpdateReplacePo licy attribute in the CloudFormation template. Send a success signal after the applications are in stalled and configured using the cfn-signal helper script is incorrect because the UpdateReplacePolicy  attribute is primarily used to retain or in some c ases, back up the existing physical instance of a resourc e when it is replaced during a stack update operati on. 103 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/lates t/UserGuide/aws-attribute-creationpolicy.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/lates t/UserGuide/deploying.applications.html#deploy ment-walkthrough-cfn-signal https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/use-a-creationp olicy-to-wait-for-on-instance-configurations/ Check out this AWS CloudFormation Cheat Sheet: https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-cloudformation/ AWS CloudFormation - Templates, Stacks, Change Sets : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Xpuprxg7aY",

        "correct": "C. C. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is used to collect and process large streams of data records in real-time. You can use Kinesis Data Streams for rapid and cont inuous data intake and aggregation. The type of dat a used includes IT infrastructure log data, applicati on logs, social media, market data feeds, and web clickstream data. Because the response time for the  data intake and processing is in real-time, the processing is typically lightweight. 104 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam The following diagram illustrates the high-level ar chitecture of Kinesis Data Streams. The producers continually push data to Kinesis Data Streams, and the consumers process the data in real-time. Consum ers (such as a custom application running on Amazon EC2  or an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream) can store their results using an AWS servic e such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Redshift, or Amazon S3. Hence, the correct answer is: Amazon Kinesis Data S treams. Amazon S3 Access Points is incorrect because this i s mainly used to manage access of your S3 objects. Amazon S3 access points are named network endpoints  that are attached to buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations, such as uploading and  retrieving objects. Amazon Redshift with AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS  CDK) is incorrect because this is mainly used for data warehousing making it simple and cost -effective to analyze your data across your data warehouse and data lake. Again, it does not meet th e requirement of being able to collect and process large streams of data in real-time. Using the AWS Cloud D evelopment Kit (AWS CDK) with Amazon Redshift still won't satisfy this requirement. Amazon Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (Amazon M SK) is incorrect. Although you can process streaming data in real-time with Amazon MSK, this s ervice still entails a lot of administrative overhe ad, unlike Amazon Kinesis.

In RDS, you still have to manually scale up your resources and create Read Replicas to impro ve scalability while in DynamoDB, this is automatically done. Amazon DynamoDB is the best option to use in this s cenario. It is a fully managed non-relational datab ase service  you simply create a database table, set yo ur target utilization for Auto Scaling, and let the  service handle the rest.

When you create a launch configuration, you specify informat ion for the instances such as the ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI), the instance type, a key pair,  one or more security groups, and a block device mapping. If you've launched an EC2 instance before,  you specified the same information in order to lau nch the instance. You can specify your launch configuration with mult iple Auto Scaling groups. However, you can only specify one launch configuration for an Auto Scalin g group at a time, and you can't modify a launch configuration after you've created it. Therefore, i f you want to change the launch configuration for a n Auto Scaling group, you must create a launch configurati on and then update your Auto Scaling group with the new launch configuration. For this scenario, you have to create a new launch configuration. Remember that you can't modify a lau nch configuration after you've created it. 108 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Hence, the correct answer is: Create a new launch c onfiguration. The option that says: Do nothing. You can start dir ectly launching EC2 instances in the Auto Scaling group with the same launch configuration is incorre ct because what you are trying to achieve is change the AMI being used by your fleet of EC2 instances.

        "correct": "D. D. Create a new IAM group and then add the users that require access to the S3 bucket.",
        "explanation": "Explanation In this scenario, the best option is to group the s et of users in an IAM Group and then apply a policy with the required access to the Amazon S3 bucket. T his will enable you to easily add, remove, and manage the users instead of manually adding a polic y to each and every 100 IAM users. Creating a new policy and applying it to multiple I AM users using a shell script is incorrect because you need a new IAM Group for this scenario and not assign a policy to each user via a shell script. Th is method can save you time but afterward, it will be difficult to manage all 100 users that are not cont ained in an IAM Group. Creating a new S3 bucket access policy with unlimit ed access for each IAM user is incorrect because you need a new IAM Group and the method is also tim e-consuming. Creating a new IAM role and adding each user to the  IAM role is incorrect because you need to use an IAM Group and not an IAM role. 111 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Reference: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_ groups.html AWS Identity Services Overview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIdUw0i8rr0 Check out this AWS IAM Cheat Sheet: https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-identity-and-access-m anagement-iam/ Tutorials Dojo's AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Exam Study Guide: https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-certified-solutions-a rchitect-associate/ 112 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam",

        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) provides bl ock-level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted  block devices. You can mount these volumes as devices on your instances. EBS volumes that are att ached to an instance are exposed as storage volumes that persist independently from the life of the ins tance. Amazon EBS is the persistent block storage volume a mong the options given. It is mainly used as the ro ot volume to store the operating system of an EC2 inst ance. To encrypt an EBS volume at rest, you can use AWS KMS customer master keys for the encryption of both the boot and data volumes of an EC2 instance. 113 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Hence, the correct answer is: Encrypted Amazon EBS volume using AWS KMS. The options that say: Amazon EC2 Instance Store wit h SSL encryption and Encrypted Amazon EC2 Instance Store using AWS KMS are both incorrect bec ause the scenario requires persistent block storage and not temporary storage. Also, enabling SSL is no t a requirement in the scenario as it is primarily used to encrypt data in transit. The option that says: Amazon EBS volume with server -side encryption (SSE) enabled is incorrect because EBS volumes are only encrypted using AWS KM S. Server-side encryption (SSE) is actually an option for Amazon S3, but not for Amazon EC2.

The option that says: Set up Server-Side Encryption  with keys stored in a separate S3 bucket is incorrect because you have to use AWS KMS to store your encryption keys or alternatively, choose an AWS-managed CMK instead to properly implement Serve r-Side Encryption in Amazon S3. In addition, storing any type of encryption key in Amazon S3 is actually a security risk and is not recommended. The option that says: Set up Client-Side encryption  with Amazon S3 managed encryption keys is incorrect because you can't have an Amazon S3 manag ed encryption key for client-side encryption. As it s name implies, an Amazon S3 managed key is fully man aged by AWS and also rotates the key automatically without any manual intervention. For this scenario, you have to set up a customer master  key (CMK) in AWS KMS that you can manage, rotate, and a udit or alternatively, use a client-side master key that you manually maintain. The option that says: Set up Server-Side encryption  (SSE) with EC2 key pair is incorrect because you can't use a key pair of your Amazon EC2 instance fo r encrypting your S3 bucket. You have to use a clie nt- side master key or a customer master key stored in AWS KMS.

Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) is a fully manage d, highly available, in-memory cache for DynamoDB that delivers up to a 10x performance impr ovement  from milliseconds to microseconds even at millions of requests per second. DAX does a ll the heavy lifting required to add in-memory acceleration to your DynamoDB tables, without requi ring developers to manage cache invalidation, data population, or cluster management. 120 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Amazon API Gateway lets you create an API that acts  as a \"front door\" for applications to access data, business logic, or functionality from your back-end  services, such as code running on AWS Lambda. Amazon API Gateway handles all of the tasks involve d in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands of concurrent API calls, including traffi c management, authorization and access control, monitoring, and API version management. Amazon API Gateway has no minimum fees or startup costs. AWS Lambda scales your functions automatically on y our behalf. Every time an event notification is received for your function, AWS Lambda quickly loca tes free capacity within its compute fleet and runs 121 of 137 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam your code. Since your code is stateless, AWS Lambda  can start as many copies of your function as neede d without lengthy deployment and configuration delays . The option that says: Configure CloudFront with Dyn amoDB as the origin; cache frequently accessed data on the client device using ElastiCache is inco rrect. Although CloudFront delivers content faster to your users using edge locations, you still cannot i ntegrate DynamoDB table with CloudFront as these tw o are incompatible. The option that says: Use AWS SSO and Cognito to au thenticate users and have them directly access DynamoDB using single-sign on. Manually set the pro visioned read and write capacity to a higher RCU and WCU is incorrect because AWS Single Sign-On  (SSO) is a cloud SSO service that just makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to multiple AWS  accounts and business applications. This will not be of much help on the scalability and performance of the application. It is costly to manually set the provisioned read and write capacity to a higher RCU  and WCU because this capacity will run round the clock and will still be the same even if the incomi ng traffic is stable and there is no need to scale. The option that says: Since Auto Scaling is enabled  by default, the provisioned read and write capacit y will adjust automatically. Also enable DynamoDB Acc elerator (DAX) to improve the performance from milliseconds to microseconds is incorrect beca use, by default, Auto Scaling is not enabled in a DynamoDB table which is created using the AWS CLI.

Certkingdom 2 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam The premise of the scenario is that the EC2 servers  have high memory usage, but since this specific me tric is not tracked by the Auto Scaling group by default , the scaling out activity is not being triggered. Remember that by default, CloudWatch doesn't monito r memory usage but only the CPU utilization, Network utilization, Disk performance, and Disk Rea ds/Writes. This is the reason why you have to install a CloudW atch agent in your EC2 instances to collect and mon itor the custom metric (memory usage), which will be use d by your Auto Scaling Group as a trigger for scali ng Certkingdom activities.

General Purpose ( SSD) volumes are suitable for a broad range of workloads, including small to medium sized database s, development, and test environments, and boot volumes. Provisioned IOPS (SSD) volumes offer storage with c onsistent and low-latency performance and are designed for I/O intensive applications such as lar ge relational or NoSQL databases. Magnetic volumes provide the lowest cost per gigabyte of all EBS vol ume types. Magnetic volumes are ideal for workloads where data  are accessed infrequently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is important. Take note that th is is a Previous Generation Volume. The latest low- cost magnetic storage types are Cold HDD (sc1) and Throu ghput Optimized HDD (st1) volumes. 5 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Hence, the correct answers are: - Provisioned IOPS volumes offer storage with consi stent and low-latency performance, and are designed for I/O intensive applications such as lar ge relational or NoSQL databases. - Magnetic volumes provide the lowest cost per giga byte of all EBS volume types and are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is important. The option that says: Spot volumes provide the lowe st cost per gigabyte of all EBS volume types and are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infr equently, and applications where the lowest storage cost is important is incorrect because ther e is no EBS type called a \"Spot volume\" however, th ere is an Instance purchasing option for Spot Instances . The option that says: General Purpose SSD (gp3) vol umes with multi-attach enabled offer consistent and low-latency performance, and are designed for a pplications requiring multi-az resiliency is incorrect because the multi-attach feature can only  be enabled on EBS Provisioned IOPS io2 or io1 volumes.

Afte r the load balancer receives a connection request, it selects a target from the target group for the defa ult rule. For UDP traffic, the load balancer select s a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol, source IP address, source port, destination IP addr ess, and destination port. A UDP flow has the same sourc e and destination, so it is consistently routed to a single target throughout its lifetime. Different UD P flows have different source IP addresses and port s, so they can be routed to different targets. Certkingdom 14 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Certkingdom In this scenario, a startup plans to create a multi player game that uses UDP as the protocol for communications.

This means that we should select Amazon DynamoDB since it supports both document and key-va lue store models. Hence, the correct answer is: Distribute the traffi c using Network Load Balancer and store the data in Amazon DynamoDB. The option that says: Distribute the traffic using Application Load Balancer and store the data in Amazon DynamoDB is incorrect because UDP is not sup ported in Application Load Balancer. Remember that UDP is a Layer 4 traffic. Therefore, you shoul d use a Network Load Balancer. The option that says: Distribute the traffic using Network Load Balancer and store the data in Amazon Aurora is incorrect because Amazon Aurora is  a relational database service. Instead of Aurora, you should use Amazon DynamoDB. The option that says: Distribute the traffic using Application Load Balancer and store the data in Amazon RDS is incorrect because Application Load Ba lancer only supports application traffic (Layer 7). Also, Amazon RDS is not suitable as a key-value sto re. You should use DynamoDB since it supports both document and key-value store models.

In AWS, there is a suite  of tools that make analyzing and processing large amounts of data in the cloud faster, including ways  to optimize and integrate existing workflows with Amazon S3: 1. S3 Select Amazon S3 Select is designed to help analyze and pr ocess data within an object in Amazon S3 buckets, faster and cheaper. It works by providing the abili ty to retrieve a subset of data from an object in A mazon S3 using simple SQL expressions. Your applications no longer have to use compute resources to scan and filter the data from an object, potentially increas ing query performance by up to 400%, and reducing q uery Certkingdom costs as much as 80%.

        "correct": "B. B. Set the IOPS to 500 then maintain a low queue length.",
        "explanation": "Explanation Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) volumes are designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly database workloads, that are sensitive  to storage performance and consistency. Unlike gp2 , 23 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam which uses a bucket and credit model to calculate p erformance, an io1 volume allows you to specify a consistent IOPS rate when you create the volume, an d Amazon EBS delivers within 10 percent of the provisioned IOPS performance 99.9 percent of the ti me over a given year. An io1 volume can range in size from 4 GiB to 16 Ti B. You can provision from 100 IOPS up to 64,000 IOPS per volume on Nitro system instance families a nd up to 32,000 on other instance families. The maximum ratio of provisioned IOPS to requested volu me size (in GiB) is 50:1. For example, a 100 GiB volume can be provisioned wi th up to 5,000 IOPS. On a supported instance type, any volume 1,280 GiB in size or greater allows prov isioning up to the 64,000 IOPS maximum (50 \u00d7 1,280 GiB = 64,000). An io1 volume provisioned with up to 32,000 IOPS su pports a maximum I/O size of 256 KiB and yields as much as 500 MiB/s of throughput. With the I/O size at the maximum, peak throughput is reached at 2,000 Certkingdom IOPS. A volume provisioned with more than 32,000 IO PS (up to the cap of 64,000 IOPS) supports a maximum I/O size of 16 KiB and yields as much as 1, 000 MiB/s of throughput. The volume queue length is the number of pending I/ O requests for a device. Latency is the true end-to -end client time of an I/O operation, in other words, th e time elapsed between sending an I/O to EBS and receiving an acknowledgement from EBS that the I/O read or write is complete. Queue length must be correctly calibrated with I/O size and latency to a void creating bottlenecks either on the guest opera ting system or on the network link to EBS. Optimal queue length varies for each workload, depe nding on your particular application's sensitivity to IOPS and latency. If your workload is not deliverin g enough I/O requests to fully use the performance available to your EBS volume then your volume might  not deliver the IOPS or throughput that you have provisioned. 24 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Transaction-intensive applications are sensitive to  increased I/O latency and are well-suited for SSD- backed io1 and gp2 volumes. You can maintain high I OPS while keeping latency down by maintaining a low queue length and a high number of IOPS availabl e to the volume. Consistently driving more IOPS to a volume than it has available can cause increased I/ O latency. Throughput-intensive applications are less sensitiv e to increased I/O latency, and are well-suited for  HDD- backed st1 and sc1 volumes. You can maintain high t hroughput to HDD-backed volumes by maintaining a high queue length when performing large, sequential  I/O. Therefore, for instance, a 10 GiB volume can be pro visioned with up to 500 IOPS. Any volume 640 GiB in size or greater allows provisioning up to a maximum  of 32,000 IOPS (50 \u00d7 640 GiB = 32,000). Hence, the correct answer is to set the IOPS to 500 then maint ain a low queue length. Setting the IOPS to 400 then maintaining a low queu e length is incorrect because although a value of 400 is an acceptable value, it is not the maximum v alue for the IOPS. You will not fully utilize the available IOPS that the volume can offer if you jus t set it to 400. The options that say: Set the IOPS to 600 then main tain a high queue length and Set the IOPS to 800 then maintain a low queue length are both incorrect  because the maximum IOPS for the 10 GiB volume is only 500. Therefore, any value greater than the maximum amount, such as 600 or 800, is wrong. Moreover, you should keep the latency down by maint aining a low queue length, and not higher.

You must also specify an Elastic IP address to asso ciate with the NAT gateway when you create it. The Elastic IP address cannot be changed once you assoc iate it with the NAT Gateway. After you've created a NAT gateway, you must update  the route table associated with one or more of you r private subnets to point Internet-bound traffic to the NAT gateway.

Which of the following is the BEST solution that th e architect should set up to support the required interconnectivity?",
        "options": [
            "A. A. Set up an AWS VPN CloudHub for inter-region VP C access and a Direct Connect gateway",

        ],
        "correct": "D. D. Set up an AWS Transit Gateway in each region t o interconnect all networks within it. Then,",
        "explanation": "Explanation AWS Transit Gateway is a service that enables custo mers to connect their Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs) and their on-premises networks to a single g ateway. As you grow the number of workloads running on AWS, you need to be able to scale your networks across multiple accounts and Amazon VPCs to keep up with the growth. Today, you can connect pairs of Amazon VPCs using p eering. However, managing point-to-point connectivity across many Amazon VPCs without the ab ility to centrally manage the connectivity policies can be operationally costly and cumbersome. For on- premises connectivity, you need to attach your AWS VPN to each individual Amazon VPC. This solution ca n be time-consuming to build and hard to manage when the number of VPCs grows into the hundreds. 32 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam With AWS Transit Gateway, you only have to create a nd manage a single connection from the central gateway to each Amazon VPC, on-premises data center , or remote office across your network. Transit Gateway acts as a hub that controls how traffic is routed among all the connected networks which act l ike spokes. This hub and spoke model significantly simp lifies management and reduces operational costs because each network only has to connect to the Tra nsit Gateway and not to every other network. Any ne w VPC is simply connected to the Transit Gateway and is then automatically available to every other netw ork that is connected to the Transit Gateway. This ease  of connectivity makes it easy to scale your networ k as you grow. certkingdom. certkingdom. certkingdom. Certkingdom certkingdom. certkingdom. It acts as a Regional virtual router for traffic fl owing between your virtual private clouds (VPC) and  VPN connections. A transit gateway scales elastically b ased on the volume of network traffic. Routing thro ugh a transit gateway operates at layer 3, where the pack ets are sent to a specific next-hop attachment, bas ed on their destination IP addresses. 33 of 130 certkingdom. Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam A transit gateway attachment is both a source and a  destination of packets. You can attach the followi ng resources to your transit gateway: - One or more VPCs - One or more VPN connections - One or more AWS Direct Connect gateways - One or more transit gateway peering connections If you attach a transit gateway peering connection,  the transit gateway must be in a different Region. Hence, the correct answer is: Set up an AWS Transit  Gateway in each region to interconnect all networks within it. Then, route traffic between the  transit gateways through a peering connection. The option that says: Set up an AWS Direct Connect Gateway to achieve inter-region VPC access to all of the AWS resources and on-premises data cente rs. Set up a link aggregation group (LAG) to aggregate multiple connections at a single AWS Dire ct Connect endpoint in order to treat them as a single, managed connection. Launch a virtual privat e gateway in each VPC and then create a public virtual interface for each AWS Direct Connect conne ction to the Direct Connect Gateway is incorrect. You can only create a private virtual interface to a Direct Connect gateway and not a public virtual interface. Using a link aggregation group (LAG) is also irrelevant in this scenario because it is just  a logical interface that uses the Link Aggregation Control Pr otocol (LACP) to aggregate multiple connections at a single AWS Direct Connect endpoint, allowing you to  treat them as a single, managed connection. The option that says: Enable inter-region VPC peeri ng which allows peering relationships to be established between VPCs across different AWS regio ns. This will ensure that the traffic will always Certkingdom stay on the global AWS backbone and will never trav erse the public Internet is incorrect. This would require a lot of manual set up and management overh ead to successfully build a functional, error-free inter- region VPC network compared with just using a Trans it Gateway. Although the Inter-Region VPC Peering provides a cost-effective way to share resources be tween regions or replicate data for geographic redundancy, its connections are not dedicated and h ighly available. Moreover, it doesn't support the company's on-premises data centers in multiple AWS Regions. The option that says: Set up an AWS VPN CloudHub fo r inter-region VPC access and a Direct Connect gateway for the VPN connections to the on-p remises data centers. Create a virtual private gateway in each VPC, then create a private virtual interface for each AWS Direct Connect connection to the Direct Connect gateway is incorre ct. This option doesn't meet the requirement of interconnecting all of the company's on-premises ne tworks, VPNs, and VPCs into a single gateway, whichincludes support for inter-region peering across mu ltiple AWS regions. As its name implies, the AWS VP N CloudHub is only for VPNs and not for VPCs. It is a lso not capable of managing hundreds of VPCs with multiple VPN connections to their data centers that  span multiple AWS Regions. 34 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam References: https://aws.amazon.com/transit-gateway/ https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/tgw/how-tran sit-gateways-work.html https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content -delivery/building-a-global-network-using-aws- transit-gateway-inter-region-peering/ Check out this AWS Transit Gateway Cheat Sheet: https://tutorialsdojo.com/aws-transit-gateway/",

Config continuously monitors and records  your AWS resource configurations and allows you to automate the evaluation of recorded configurations against desired configurations. In the scenario given, we can utilize AWS Config to  check for compliance on the password policy by configuring the Config rule to check the IAM_PASSWO RD_POLICY on an account. Additionally, because Config integrates with AWS Organizations, w e can improve the set up to aggregate compliance Certkingdom information across accounts to a central dashboard.

        "explanation": "Explanation A security group acts as a virtual firewall for you r instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.  When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign up to five security groups to the instance. Security g roups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Th erefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC can be assigned to a different set of security groups. If you launch an instance using the Amazon EC2 API or a command line tool and you don't specify a security group, the instance is automatically assig ned to the default security group for the VPC. If y ou launch an instance using the Amazon EC2 console, yo u have an option to create a new security group for the instance. Certkingdom For each security group, you add rules that control  the inbound traffic to instances, and a separate s et of rules that control the outbound traffic. This secti on describes the basic things that you need to know  about security groups for your VPC and their rules. Amazon security groups and network ACLs don't filte r traffic to or from link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16) or AWS reserved IPv4 addresses (th ese are the first four IPv4 addresses of the subnet , 64 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam including the Amazon DNS server address for the VPC ). Similarly, flow logs do not capture IP traffic t o or from these addresses. In the scenario, the security group configuration a llows any server (0.0.0.0/0) from anywhere to estab lish an MS SQL connection to the database via the 1433 p ort. The most suitable solution here is to change t he Source field to the security group ID attached to t he application tier. Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: For the MS SQL rule, change the Source to the security group ID attached to the application tier. The option that says: For the MS SQL rule, change t he Source to the EC2 instance IDs of the underlying instances of the Auto Scaling group is i ncorrect because using the EC2 instance IDs of the underlying instances of the Auto Scaling group as t he source can cause intermittent issues. New instan ces will be added and old instances will be removed fro m the Auto Scaling group over time, which means tha t you have to manually update the security group sett ing once again. A better solution is to use the sec urity group ID of the Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances . The option that says: For the MS SQL rule, change t he Source to the static AnyCast IP address attached to the application tier is incorrect becau se a static AnyCast IP address is primarily used fo r AWS Global Accelerator and not for security group c onfigurations. The option that says: For the MS SQL rule, change t he Source to the Network ACL ID attached to the application tier is incorrect because you have to u se the security group ID instead of the Network ACL  ID of the application tier. Take note that the Network  ACL covers the entire subnet which means that othe r applications that use the same subnet will also be affected.

Amazon EFS is a fil e storage service for use with Amazon EC2. Amazon EFS provides a file system interface, file s ystem access semantics (such as strong consistency and file locking), and concurrently-accessible storage for up to thousands of Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon S3 is an object storage service. Amazon S3 makes da ta available through an Internet API that can be accessed anywhere. Amazon EBS is a block-level stor age service for use with Amazon EC2. Amazon EBS can deliver performance for workloads that require the lowest-latency access to data from a single EC2 instance.

In this scenario, the company is looking for a stor age service which can provide the lowest-latency ac cess to their data which will be fetched by a single m5a d.24xlarge Reserved EC2 instance. This type of workloads can be supported better by using either E FS or EBS but in this case, the latter is the most suitable storage service. As mentioned above, EBS p rovides the lowest-latency access to the data for y our EC2 instance since the volume is directly attached to the instance.

Certkingdom 66 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Storage Gateway is incorrect since this is primaril y used to extend your on-premises storage to your A WS Certkingdom Cloud. S3 is incorrect because although this is also highl y available and highly scalable, it still does not provide the lowest-latency access to the data, unlike EBS. Remember that S3 does not reside within your VPC by default, which means the data will traverse the pub lic Internet that may result to higher latency. You  can set up a VPC Endpoint for S3 yet still, its latency is greater than that of EBS. EFS is incorrect because the scenario does not requ ire concurrently-accessible storage since the inter nal application is only hosted in one instance. Althoug h EFS can provide low latency data access to the EC 2 instance as compared with S3, the storage service t hat can provide the lowest latency access is still EBS.

So if the application requires  a minimum of 4 instances, there should be at least  4 instances running in case there is an outage in one  of the Availability Zones or if there are server i ssues. One of the differences between Fault Tolerance and High Availability is that the former refers to the minimum number of running instances. For example, y ou have a system that requires a minimum of 4 running instances and currently has 6 running insta nces deployed in two Availability Zones. There was a Certkingdom component failure in one of the Availability Zones which knocks out 3 instances.

        "explanation": "Explanation To collect logs from your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises servers into CloudWatch Logs, AWS offers both a new unified CloudWatch agent, and an older CloudWatch Logs agent. It is recommended to use the unified CloudWatch agent which has the foll owing advantages: - You can collect both logs and advanced metrics wi th the installation and configuration of just one a gent. - The unified agent enables the collection of logs from servers running Windows Server. - If you are using the agent to collect CloudWatch metrics, the unified agent also enables the collect ion of additional system metrics, for in-guest visibility. - The unified agent provides better performance. Certkingdom CloudWatch Logs Insights enables you to interactive ly search and analyze your log data in Amazon CloudWatch Logs. You can perform queries to help yo u quickly and effectively respond to operational issues.

Enable CloudWatch detailed monitoring and 78 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam use CloudWatch Logs Insights to analyze the log dat a of all instances is incorrect. Although this is a valid solution, this entails a lot of effort to imp lement as you have to allocate time to install the AWS SDK to each instance and develop a custom monitoring so lution. Remember that the question is specifically looking for a solution that can be implemented with  minimal effort. In addition, it is unnecessary and  not cost-efficient to enable detailed monitoring in Clo udWatch in order to meet the requirements of this scenario since this can be done using CloudWatch Lo gs. The option that says: Install the AWS Systems Manag er Agent (SSM Agent) in each instance which will automatically collect and push data to CloudWa tch Logs. Analyze the log data with CloudWatch Logs Insights is incorrect. Although this is also a  valid solution, it is more efficient to use CloudW atch agent than an SSM agent. Manually connecting to an instance to view log files and troubleshoot an issu e with SSM Agent is time-consuming hence, for more ef ficient instance monitoring, you can use the CloudWatch Agent instead to send the log data to Am azon CloudWatch Logs. The option that says: Install AWS Inspector Agent i n each instance which will collect and push data to CloudWatch Logs periodically. Set up a CloudWatch d ashboard to properly analyze the log data of all instances is incorrect because AWS Inspector is  simply a security assessments service which only h elps you in checking for unintended network accessibilit y of your EC2 instances and for vulnerabilities on those EC2 instances. Furthermore, setting up an Amazon Cl oudWatch dashboard is not suitable since its primarily used for scenarios where you have to moni tor your resources in a single view, even those resources that are spread across different AWS Regi ons.

The first requirement means that you have to use an application load balancer (ALB) to d istribute the incoming traffic to your application servers. Certkingdom The second requirement specifies that both your app lication and database tier should not be accessible  from the public Internet. This means that you could crea te a single private subnet for both of your applica tion and database tier. However, the third requirement m entioned that the database tier should not share th e same subnet with other AWS resources to protect its  sensitive data. This means that you should provisi on one private subnet for your application tier and an other private subnet for your database tier. The last requirement alludes to the need for using at least two Availability Zones to achieve high availability.

This new public subnet is on to p of the private subnet that is used by your privat e EC2 instances. Lastly, you should associate these publi c subnets to the Internet-facing load balancer to c omplete the setup. To summarize, we need to have one private subnet fo r the application tier and another one for the data base Certkingdom tier. We then need to create another public subnet in the same Availability Zone where the private EC2 instances are hosted, in order to properly connect the public Internet-facing load balancer to your in stances. This means that we have to use a total of 3 subnets  consisting of 2 private subnets and 1 public subne t. To meet the requirement of high availability, we ha ve to deploy the stack to two Availability Zones. T his means that you have to double the number of subnets  you are using.

Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam As an example of a Vault Lock policy, suppose that you are required to retain archives for one year be fore you can delete them. To implement this requirement,  you can create a Vault Lock policy that denies use rs permissions to delete an archive until the archive has existed for one year. You can test this policy before locking it down. After you lock the policy, the pol icy becomes immutable. For more information about t he locking process, see Amazon S3 Glacier Vault Lock. If you want to manage other user permissions that c an be changed, you can use the vault access policy Amazon S3 Glacier supports the following archive op erations: Upload, Download, and Delete. Archives are immutable and cannot be modified. Hence, the co rrect answer is to store the audit logs in a Glacie r vault and use the Vault Lock feature. certkingdom. Storing the audit logs in an EBS volume and then ta king EBS snapshots every month is incorrect because this is not a suitable and secure solution.  Anyone who has access to the EBS Volume can simply delete and modify the audit logs. Snapshots can be deleted too. Storing the audit logs in an Amazon S3 bucket and e nabling Multi-Factor Authentication Delete (MFA Delete) on the S3 bucket is incorrect because this would still not meet the requirement. If someo ne certkingdom. has access to the S3 bucket and also has the proper  MFA privileges then the audit logs can be edited. Storing the audit logs in an EFS volume and using N etwork File System version 4 (NFSv4) file- locking mechanism is incorrect because the data int egrity of the audit logs can still be compromised i f it is stored in an EFS volume with Network File System ve rsion 4 (NFSv4) file-locking mechanism and hence, not suitable as storage for the files.

        "explanation": "Explanation If your identity store is not compatible with SAML 2.0 then you can build a custom identity broker application to perform a similar function. The brok er application authenticates users, requests tempor ary credentials for users from AWS, and then provides t hem to the user to access AWS resources. Certkingdom The application verifies that employees are signed into the existing corporate network's identity and authentication system, which might use LDAP, Active  Directory, or another system.

To get temporary security credentials, the identity  broker application calls either AssumeRole or GetFederationToken to obtain temporary security cre dentials, depending on how you want to manage the policies for users and when the temporary credentia ls should expire. The call returns temporary securi ty credentials consisting of an AWS access key ID, a s ecret access key, and a session token.

You can use Amazon EC2 to  launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and networking, and manage  storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or Certkingdom down to handle changes in requirements or spikes in  popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic . 93 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam RAID 0 configuration enables you to improve your st orage volumes' performance by distributing the I/O across the volumes in a stripe. Therefore, if you a dd a storage volume, you get the straight addition of throughput and IOPS. This configuration can be impl emented on both EBS or instance store volumes. Since the main requirement in the scenario is stora ge performance, you need to use an instance store volume. It uses NVMe or SATA-based SSD to deliver h igh random I/O performance. This type of storage is a good option when you need storage with very lo w latency, and you don't need the data to persist w hen the instance terminates.

AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is a servi ce that combines secure, highly available hardware and software to provide a key management s ystem scaled for the cloud. Amazon S3 uses AWS KMS customer master keys (CMKs) to encrypt your Ama zon S3 objects. SSE-KMS encrypts only the 97 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam object data. Any object metadata is not encrypted. If you use customer-managed CMKs, you use AWS KMS via the AWS Management Console or AWS KMS APIs to centrally create encryption keys, define the policies that control how keys can be used, and  audit key usage to prove that they are being used correctly. You can use these keys to protect your d ata in Amazon S3 buckets. A customer master key (CMK) is a logical representa tion of a master key. The CMK includes metadata, such as the key ID, creation date, description, and  key state. The CMK also contains the key material used to encrypt and decrypt data. You can use a CMK to e ncrypt and decrypt up to 4 KB (4096 bytes) of data. Typically, you use CMKs to generate, encrypt, and d ecrypt the data keys that you use outside of AWS KMS to encrypt your data. This strategy is known as  envelope encryption. You have three mutually exclusive options depending  on how you choose to manage the encryption keys: Use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed K eys (SSE-S3)  Each object is encrypted with Certkingdom a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encryp ts the key itself with a master key that it regular ly rotates. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the st rongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data . Use Server-Side Encryption with Customer Master Key s (CMKs) Stored in AWS Key Management Service (SSE-KMS)  Similar to SSE-S3, but with some  additional benefits and charges for using this service. There are separate permissions for the use  of a CMK that provides added protection against unauthorized access of your objects in Amazon S3. S SE-KMS also provides you with an audit trail that shows when your CMK was used and by whom. Additiona lly, you can create and manage customer- managed CMKs or use AWS managed CMKs that are uniqu e to you, your service, and your Region. Use Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided K eys (SSE-C)  You manage the encryption keys and Amazon S3 manages the encryption, as it writes to disks, and decryption when you access your objec ts. 98 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam In the scenario, the company needs to store financi al files in AWS which are accessed every week and t he solution should use envelope encryption. This requi rement can be fulfilled by using an Amazon S3 configured with Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS -Managed Keys (SSE-KMS). Hence, using Amazon S3 to store the data and configuring Server- Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS) are the correct answers. Using Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive to store the d ata is incorrect. Although this provides the most cost-effective storage solution, it is not the appr opriate service to use if the files being stored ar e frequently accessed every week. Configuring Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Pr ovided Keys (SSE-C) and configuring Server- Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3 ) are both incorrect. Although you can configure automatic key rotation, these two do not provide you with an audit trail that shows when you r CMK was used and by whom, unlike Server-Side Encryp tion with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS).

Howev er, AWS does charge for the storage of any Amazon EBS volumes. 119 of 130 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Hence, a running EC2 Instance and EBS Volumes attac hed to stopped EC2 Instances are the right answers and conversely, a stopped On-Demand EC2 Ins tance is incorrect as there is no charge for a stopped EC2 instance that you have shut down. Using Amazon VPC is incorrect because there are no additional charges for creating and using the VPC itself. Usage charges for other Amazon Web Services , including Amazon EC2, still apply at published ra tes for those resources, including data transfer charge s. Public Data Set is incorrect due to the fact that A mazon stores the data sets at no charge to the comm unity and, as with all AWS services, you pay only for the  compute and storage you use for your own applicati ons.

Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam support OS-bypass capabilities. OS-bypass enables H PC and machine learning applications to bypass the operating system kernel and to communicate directly  with the EFA device. Hence, the correct answer is to attach an Elastic F abric Adapter (EFA) on each Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC). Attaching an Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on each Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) is incorrect because El astic Network Adapter (ENA) doesn't have OS- bypass capabilities, unlike EFA. Attaching an Elastic Network Interface (ENI) on eac h Amazon EC2 instance to accelerate High Performance Computing (HPC) is incorrect because an  Elastic Network Interface (ENI) is simply a logical networking component in a VPC that represen ts a virtual network card.

        "correct": "",
        "explanation": "Explanation You can add rules in a lifecycle configuration to t ell Amazon S3 to transition objects to another Amaz on S3 certkingdom. storage class. For example: When you know that obje cts are infrequently accessed, you might transition them to the STANDARD_IA storage class. Or transitio n your data to the GLACIER storage class in case you want to archive objects that you don't need to access in real time. In a lifecycle configuration, you can define rules to transition objects from one storage class to ano ther to Certkingdom save on storage costs. When you don't know the acce ss patterns of your objects or your access patterns  are changing over time, you can transition the objects to the INTELLIGENT_TIERING storage class for certkingdom. automatic cost savings. The lifecycle storage class transitions have a cons traint when you want to transition from the STANDAR D storage classes to either STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA . The following constraints apply: - For larger objects, there is a cost benefit for t ransitioning to STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA. Amazon S3 does not transition objects that are smaller tha n 128 KB to the STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA certkingdom. storage classes because it's not cost effective. - Objects must be stored at least 30 days in the cu rrent storage class before you can transition them to STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA. For example, you cannot create a lifecycle rule to transition objects to the STANDARD_IA storage class one day after you cre ate them. Amazon S3 doesn't transition objects .  10 of 128 certkingdom. Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam within the first 30 days because newer objects are often accessed more frequently or deleted sooner th an is suitable for STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA storage. - If you are transitioning noncurrent objects (in v ersioned buckets), you can transition only objects that are at least 30 days noncurrent to STANDARD_IA or ONEZO NE_IA storage. Certkingdom Since there is a time constraint in transitioning o bjects in S3, you can only change the storage class  of your objects from S3 Standard storage class to STANDARD_ IA or ONEZONE_IA storage after 30 days. This limitation does not apply on INTELLIGENT_TIERING, G LACIER, and DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class. In addition, the requirement says that the media as sets should be fetched in a matter of minutes for a surprise annual data audit. This means that the ret rieval will only happen once a year. You can use expedited retrievals in Glacier which will allow yo u to quickly access your data (within 15 minutes) w hen occasional urgent requests for a subset of archives  are required. .  11 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam In this scenario, you can set a lifecycle policy in  the bucket to transition to S3 - Standard IA after  30 days or alternatively, you can directly transition your data to Glacier after one week (7 days). Hence, the following are the correct answers: - Set a lifecycle policy in the bucket to transitio n the data from Standard storage class to Glacier after one week (7 days). - Set a lifecycle policy in the bucket to transitio n to S3 - Standard IA after 30 days. Setting a lifecycle policy in the bucket to transit ion the data to S3 - Standard IA storage class afte r one week (7 days) and setting a lifecycle policy in  the bucket to transition the data to S3 - One Zone - Infrequent Access storage class after one week (7 d ays) are both incorrect because there is a constrai nt in S3 that objects must be stored at least 30 days in the current storage class before you can transition  them to STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA. You cannot create a life cycle rule to transition objects to either STANDARD_IA or ONEZONE_IA storage class 7 days afte r you create them because you can only do this after the 30-day period has elapsed. Hence, th ese options are incorrect. Setting a lifecycle policy in the bucket to transit ion the data to S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage cla ss after one week (7 days) is incorrect because althou gh DEEP_ARCHIVE storage class provides the most cost-effective storage option, it does not have the  ability to do expedited retrievals, unlike Glacier . In the event that the surprise annual data audit happens, it may take several hours before you can retrieve y our data.

        "correct": "A. A. Remove the NAT instance and create an S3 gatew ay endpoint to access S3 objects.",
        "explanation": "Explanation A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect you r VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without re quiring an Internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Insta nces in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traff ic between your VPC and the other services does not leave the Amazon network. Endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontall y scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components that allow communication between instanc es in your VPC and services without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your  network traffic. .  25 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam There are two types of VPC endpoints: interface end points and gateway endpoints. You should create the type of VPC endpoint required by the supported serv ice. As a rule of thumb, most AWS services use VPC Interface Endpoint except for S3 and DynamoDB, whic h use VPC Gateway Endpoint. There is no additional charge for using gateway end points. However, standard charges for data transfer  and resource usage still apply. Let's assume you created a NAT gateway and you have  an EC2 instance routing to the Internet through th e NAT gateway. Your EC2 instance behind the NAT gatew ay sends a 1 GB file to one of your S3 buckets. Certkingdom The EC2 instance, NAT gateway, and S3 Bucket are in  the same region US East (Ohio), and the NAT gateway and EC2 instance are in the same availabili ty zone. Your cost will be calculated as follows: - NAT Gateway Hourly Charge: NAT Gateway is charged  on an hourly basis. For example, the rate is $0.045 per hour in this region. - NAT Gateway Data Processing Charge: 1 GB data wen t through NAT gateway. The NAT Gateway Data Processing charge is applied and will result i n a charge of $0.045. - Data Transfer Charge: This is the standard EC2 Da ta Transfer charge. 1 GB data was transferred from the EC2 instance to S3 via the NAT gateway. There w as no charge for the data transfer from the EC2 instance to S3 as it is Data Transfer Out to Amazon  EC2 to S3 in the same region. There was also no charge for the data transfer between the NAT Gatewa y and the EC2 instance since the traffic stays in t he .  26 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam same availability zone using private IP addresses. There will be a data transfer charge between your N AT Gateway and EC2 instance if they are in the differe nt availability zone. In summary, your charge will be $0.045 for 1 GB of data processed by the NAT gateway and a charge of $0.045 per hour will always apply once the NAT gate way is provisioned and available. The data transfer has no charge in this example. However, if you send  the file to a non-AWS Internet location instead, t here will be a data transfer charge as it is data transf er out from Amazon EC2 to the Internet. To avoid the NAT Gateway Data Processing charge in this example, you could set up a Gateway Type VPC endpoint and route the traffic to/from S3 throu gh the VPC endpoint instead of going through the NA T Gateway. There is no data processing or hourly charges for u sing Gateway Type VPC endpoints. Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: Remove the NAT instance and create an S3 gateway endpoint to access S3 objects. The option that says: Replace the NAT instance with  NAT Gateway to access S3 objects is incorrect. A NAT Gateway is just a NAT instance that is managed for you by AWS. It provides less operational management and you pay for the hour that your NAT G ateway is running. This is not the most effective solution since you will still pay for the idle time . The option that says: Use a smaller instance type f or the NAT instance is incorrect. Although this mig ht reduce the cost, it still is not the most cost-effi cient solution. An S3 Gateway endpoint is still the  best solution because it comes with no additional charge . The option that says: Remove the NAT instance and c reate an S3 interface endpoint to access S3 objects is incorrect. An interface endpoint is an e lastic network interface with a private IP address from the Certkingdom IP address range of your subnet. Unlike a Gateway e ndpoint, you still get billed for the time your int erface endpoint is running and the GB data it has processe d. From a cost standpoint, using the S3 Gateway endpoint is the most favorable solution.

You can launch a combination of EC2 instances to set up a cost-effective architecture depending o n your workload. You can launch Reserved EC2 instances to process the mission-critical data and Spot EC2 instances for processing non-essential bat ch jobs. .  31 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam There are two different charge models for Amazon El astic Container Service (ECS): Fargate Launch Type Model and EC2 Launch Type Model. With Fargate, you pay for the amount of vCPU and memory resources that your containerized application reque sts while for EC2 launch type model, there is no additional charge. You pay for AWS resources (e.g. EC2 instances or EBS volumes) you create to store a nd run your application. You only pay for what you use , as you use it; there are no minimum fees and no upfront commitments. Certkingdom In this scenario, the most cost-effective solution is to use ECS as the container management service t hen set up a combination of Reserved and Spot EC2 Instances  for processing mission-critical and non-essential batch jobs respectively. You can use Scheduled Rese rved Instances (Scheduled Instances) which enables you to purchase capacity reservations that recur on a daily, weekly , or monthly basis, with a specified start time and duration, for a one-year term.

Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: Use ECS as the container management service then se t up a combination of Reserved and Spot EC2 Instances  for processing mission-critical and non- essential batch jobs respectively. Using ECS as the container management service then setting up Reserved EC2 Instances for processing both mission-critical and non-essential batch jobs is incorrect because processing the non- .  32 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam essential batch jobs can be handled much cheaper by  using Spot EC2 instances instead of Reserved Instances.

With the VPC  endpoint service, you are the service provider whe re you can create your own application in your VPC and  configure it as an AWS PrivateLink-powered service (referred to as an endpoint service). Other AWS pri ncipals can create a connection from their VPC to y our endpoint service using an interface VPC endpoint. The option that says: Changing the web architecture  to access the financial data in S3 through an interface VPC endpoint, which is powered by AWS Pri vateLink is incorrect.

Each S3 prefix can support these request ra tes, making it simple to increase performance Certkingdom significantly. Applications running on Amazon S3 today will enjoy this performance improvement with no changes, and customers building new applications on S3 do not ha ve to make any application customizations to achiev e this performance. Amazon S3's support for parallel requests means you can scale your S3 performance by the factor of your compute cluster, without making any customizations to your application. Performance scales per prefix, so you can use as many prefixes as you need in parallel to achieve the required throughput. There are no limits to the number of pr efixes. .  43 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam This S3 request rate performance increase removes a ny previous guidance to randomize object prefixes t o achieve faster performance. That means you can now use logical or sequential naming patterns in S3 obj ect naming without any performance implications. This i mprovement is now available in all AWS Regions. Using Byte-Range Fetches to retrieve multiple range s of an object data per GET request is incorrect because although a Byte-Range Fetch helps you achie ve higher aggregate throughput, Amazon S3 does not support retrieving multiple ranges of data per GET request. Using the Range HTTP header in a GET Objec t request, you can fetch a byte-range from an object,  transferring only the specified portion. You can u se concurrent connections to Amazon S3 to fetch differ ent byte ranges from within the same object. Fetchi ng smaller ranges of a large object also allows your a pplication to improve retry times when requests are interrupted. Certkingdom Adding a random prefix to the key names is incorrec t. Adding a random prefix is not required in this scenario because S3 can now scale automatically to adjust perfomance. You do not need to add a random prefix anymore for this purpose since S3 has increa sed performance to support at least 3,500 requests per second to add data and 5,500 requests per second to  retrieve data, which covers the workload in the scenario. Using a predictable naming scheme in the key names such as sequential numbers or date time sequences is incorrect because Amazon S3 already ma intains an index of object key names in each AWS region. S3 stores key names in alphabetical order. The key name dictates which partition the key is st ored in. Using a sequential prefix increases the likelih ood that Amazon S3 will target a specific partition  for a large number of your keys, overwhelming the I/O cap acity of the partition.

Bulk retrievals are S3 Glacie r's lowest-cost retrieval option, enabling you to retri eve large amounts, even petabytes, of data inexpens ively in a day. Bulk retrievals typically complete within  5  12 hours. You can specify an absolute or relati ve time period (including 0 days) after which the spec ified Amazon S3 objects should be transitioned to Amazon Glacier. Certkingdom Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: Upload the data to S3 and set a lifecycle policy to transition data to Glacier after 0 days. Glacier has a management console that you can use t o create and delete vaults. However, you cannot directly upload archives to Glacier by using the ma nagement console. To upload data such as photos, videos, and other documents, you must either use th e AWS CLI or write code to make requests by using either the REST API directly or by using the AWS SD Ks. Take note that uploading data to the S3 Console and  setting its storage class of \"Glacier\" is a differ ent story as the proper way to upload data to Glacier is stil l via its API or CLI. In this way, you can set up y our vaults and configure your retrieval options. If you  uploaded your data using the S3 console then it wi ll be managed via S3 even though it is internally using a  Glacier storage class. .  46 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Uploading the data to S3 then using a lifecycle pol icy to transfer data to S3-IA is incorrect because using Glacier would be a more cost-effective soluti on than using S3-IA. Since the required retrieval p eriod should not exceed more than a day, Glacier would be  the best choice. Uploading the data to Amazon FSx for Windows File S erver using the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol is incorrect because this option costs mor e than Amazon Glacier, which is more suitable for storing infrequently accessed data. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server provides fully managed, highly reliable, and scalable file storage that is accessi ble over the industry-standard Server Message Block  (SMB) protocol. Uploading the data to S3 then using a lifecycle pol icy to transfer data to S3 One Zone-IA is incorrect because with S3 One Zone-IA, the data will only be stored in a single availability zone and thus, this storage solution is not durable.

        "explanation": "Explanation The visibility timeout is a period of time during w hich Amazon SQS prevents other consuming components from receiving and processing a message. Certkingdom When a consumer receives and processes a message fr om a queue, the message remains in the queue. Amazon SQS doesn't automatically delete the message . Because Amazon SQS is a distributed system, there's no guarantee that the consumer actually rec eives the message (for example, due to a connectivi ty issue, or due to an issue in the consumer applicati on). Thus, the consumer must delete the message fro m the queue after receiving and processing it. Immediately after the message is received, it remai ns in the queue. To prevent other consumers from processing the message again, Amazon SQS sets a vis ibility timeout, a period of time during which Amazon SQS prevents other consumers from receiving and processing the message. The default visibility timeout for a message is 30 seconds. The maximum is  12 hours.

It supports network speeds of up to 100 Gbps for suppo rted instance types. Elastic Network Adapters (ENAs ) provide traditional IP networking features that are  required to support VPC networking. An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is simply an Elasti c Network Adapter (ENA) with added capabilities. It provides all of the functionality of an ENA, with a dditional OS-bypass functionality. OS-bypass is an access model that allows HPC and machine learning a pplications to communicate directly with the networ k interface hardware to provide low-latency, reliable  transport functionality. The OS-bypass capabilities of EFAs are not supporte d on Windows instances. If you attach an EFA to a Windows instance, the instance functions as an Elas tic Network Adapter, without the added EFA capabilities. Hence, the correct answer is to enable Enhanced Net working with Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on the Windows EC2 Instances. Enabling Enhanced Networking with Elastic Fabric Ad apter (EFA) on the Windows EC2 Instances is incorrect because the OS-bypass capabilities of the Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) are not supported on Windows instances.

However, the  traffic coming from your VPC to your S3 bucket is traversing the public Internet by default. To bette r protect your data in transit, you can set up a VP C endpoint so the incoming traffic from your VPC will  not pass through the public Internet, but instead through the private AWS network. A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect you r VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring a n Internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or .  84 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VP C do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other services does not le ave the Amazon network. Endpoints are virtual devices.

        "explanation": "Explanation AWS Storage Gateway is a set of hybrid cloud servic es that gives you on-premises access to virtually unlimited cloud storage. Customers use Storage Gate way to integrate AWS Cloud storage with existing on-site workloads so they can simplify storage mana gement and reduce costs for key hybrid cloud storag e use cases.

AWS DataSync is an online data transfer service tha t simplifies, automates, and accelerates moving dat a between on-premises storage systems and AWS Storage  services, as well as between AWS Storage services. You can use DataSync to migrate active datasets to AWS, archive data to free up on-premises storage capacity, replicate data to AWS for business contin uity, or transfer data to the cloud for analysis an d processing. Both AWS Storage Gateway and AWS DataSync can send data from your on-premises data center to AWS and vice versa. However, AWS Storage Gateway is mor e suitable to be used in integrating your storage services by replicating your data while AWS DataSyn c is better for workloads that require you to move or migrate your data.

AWS DataSync enables you to automate and accelerate online data transfers to  AWS storage services. File Gateway is a fully mana ged solution that will automate and accelerate the repl ication of data between the on-premises storage sys tems and AWS storage services. AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you ena ble governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of your AWS account. Actions taken by  a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as ev ents in CloudTrail. Events include actions taken in the AWS  Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs. There are two types of events that you configure yo ur CloudTrail for: - Management Events - Data Events Management Events provide visibility into managemen t operations that are performed on resources in your AWS account. These are also known as control p lane operations. Management events can also include non-API events that occur in your account. Data Events, on the other hand, provide visibility into the resource operations performed on or within  a resource. These are also known as data plane operat ions. It allows granular control of data event logg ing with advanced event selectors. You can currently lo g data events on different resource types such as Amazon S3 object-level API activity (e.g. GetObject , DeleteObject, and PutObject API operations), AWS Lambda function execution activity (the Invoke API) , DynamoDB Item actions, and many more. Certkingdom .  94 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam With S3 Object Lock, you can store objects using a write-once-read-many (WORM) model. Object Lock can help prevent objects from being deleted or over written for a fixed amount of time or indefinitely.  You can use Object Lock to help meet regulatory require ments that require WORM storage or to simply add another layer of protection against object changes and deletion. Certkingdom .  95 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam You can record the actions that are taken by users,  roles, or AWS services on Amazon S3 resources and maintain log records for auditing and compliance pu rposes. To do this, you can use server access loggi ng, AWS CloudTrail logging, or a combination of both. A WS recommends that you use AWS CloudTrail for logging bucket and object-level actions for your Am azon S3 resources. Hence, the correct answer is: Set up AWS DataSync t o move the existing health records from the on- premises network to the AWS Cloud. Launch a new Ama zon S3 bucket to store existing and new records. Enable AWS CloudTrail with Data Events and  Amazon S3 Object Lock in the bucket. The option that says: Set up AWS Storage Gateway to  move the existing health records from the on- premises network to the AWS Cloud. Launch a new Ama zon S3 bucket to store existing and new records. Enable AWS CloudTrail with Management Even ts and Amazon S3 Object Lock in the bucket is incorrect. The requirement explicitly say s that the Solutions Architect must immediately mov e the existing records to AWS and not integrate or re plicate the data. Using AWS DataSync is a more suitable service to use here since the primary obje ctive is to migrate or move data. You also have to use Data Events here and not Management Events in Cloud Trail, to properly track all the data access and changes to your objects. The option that says: Set up AWS Storage Gateway to  move the existing health records from the on- premises network to the AWS Cloud. Launch an Amazon  EBS-backed EC2 instance to store both the existing and new records. Enable Amazon S3 server a ccess logging and S3 Object Lock in the bucket is incorrect. Just as mentioned in the previous opt ion, using AWS Storage Gateway is not a recommended service to use in this situation since the objectiv e is to move the obsolete data. Moreover, using Ama zon EBS to store health records is not a scalable solut ion compared with Amazon S3. Enabling server access logging can help audit the stored objects. However,  it is better to CloudTrail as it provides more gra nular access control and tracking. Certkingdom The option that says: Set up AWS DataSync to move t he existing health records from the on-premises network to the AWS Cloud. Launch a new Amazon S3 bu cket to store existing and new records. Enable AWS CloudTrail with Management Events and Am azon S3 Object Lock in the bucket is incorrect.

        "correct": "D. D. Block the IP addresses in the Network Access C ontrol List",
        "explanation": "Explanation Certkingdom A network access control list (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firew all for controlling traffic in and out of one or more s ubnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules si milar to your security groups in order to add an addition al layer of security to your VPC. .  97 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Certkingdom The following are the basic things that you need to  know about network ACLs: - Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable de fault network ACL. By default, it allows all inboun d and outbound IPv4 traffic and, if applicable, IPv6 traffic. - You can create a custom network ACL and associate  it with a subnet. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until y ou add rules. - Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a  network ACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a network ACL, the subnet is automatica lly associated with the default network ACL. - You can associate a network ACL with multiple sub nets; however, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time. When you associate a net work ACL with a subnet, the previous association is removed. .  98 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam - A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules t hat we evaluate in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, to determine whether traffic is allo wed in or out of any subnet associated with the net work ACL. The highest number that you can use for a rule  is 32766. We recommend that you start by creating rules in increments (for example, increments of 10 or 100) so that you can insert new rules where you need to later on. - A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound r ules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffi c. - Network ACLs are stateless; responses to allowed inbound traffic are subject to the rules for outbou nd traffic (and vice versa). The scenario clearly states that it requires the qu ickest way to fix the security vulnerability. In th is situation, you can manually block the offending IP addresses u sing Network ACLs since the IT Security team alread y identified the list of offending IP addresses. Alte rnatively, you can set up a bastion host, however, this option entails additional time to properly set up a s you have to configure the security configurations  of your bastion host. Hence, blocking the IP addresses in the Network Acc ess Control List is the best answer since it can quickly resolve the issue by blocking the IP addres ses using Network ACL. Placing the EC2 instances into private subnets is i ncorrect because if you deploy the EC2 instance in the private subnet without public or EIP address, it wo uld not be accessible over the Internet, even to yo u. Removing the Internet Gateway from the VPC is incor rect because doing this will also make your EC2 instance inaccessible to you as it will cut down th e connection to the Internet. Assigning a static Anycast IP address to each EC2 i nstance is incorrect because a static Anycast IP address is primarily used by AWS Global Accelerator  to enable organizations to seamlessly route traffi c to Certkingdom multiple regions and improve availability and perfo rmance for their end-users.

A  single VPN tunnel still has a maximum throughput of 1.25 Gbps. If you establish multiple VPN tunnels  to an ECMP-enabled transit gateway, it can scale beyond the default limit of 1.25 Gbps. Hence, the correct answer is: Associate the VPCs to  an Equal Cost Multipath Routing (ECMR)- enabled transit gateway and attach additional VPN t unnels. The option that says: Add more virtual private gate ways to a VPC and enable Equal Cost Multipath Certkingdom Routing (ECMR) to get higher VPN bandwidth is incor rect because a VPC can only have a single virtual private gateway attached to it one at a tim e.

        "explanation": "Explanation .  123 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Application Load Balancers support Weighted Target Groups routing. With this feature, you will be able  to do weighted routing of the traffic forwarded by a r ule to multiple target groups. This enables various  use cases like blue-green, canary and hybrid deployment s without the need for multiple load balancers. It even enables zero-downtime migration between on-premises  and cloud or between different compute types like EC2 and Lambda. To divert 50% of the traffic to the new application  in AWS and the other 50% to the application, you c an also use Route 53 with Weighted routing policy. Thi s will divert the traffic between the on-premises a nd AWS-hosted application accordingly. Certkingdom Weighted routing lets you associate multiple resour ces with a single domain name (tutorialsdojo.com) o r subdomain name (portal.tutorialsdojo.com) and choos e how much traffic is routed to each resource. This can be useful for a variety of purposes, including load balancing and testing new versions of software . You can set a specific percentage of how much traffic w ill be allocated to the resource by specifying the weights. For example, if you want to send a tiny portion of your traffic to one resource and the rest to anothe r resource, you might specify weights of 1 and 255. T he resource with a weight of 1 gets 1/256th of the traffic (1/1+255), and the other resource gets 255/ 256ths (255/1+255). You can gradually change the balance by changing th e weights. If you want to stop sending traffic to a resource, you can change the weight for that record  to 0. .  124 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam When you create a target group in your Application Load Balancer, you specify its target type. This determines the type of target you specify when regi stering with this target group. You can select the following target types: 1. instance - The targets are specified by instance  ID. 2. ip - The targets are IP addresses. 3. Lambd a - The target is a Lambda function. Certkingdom When the target type is ip, you can specify IP addr esses from one of the following CIDR blocks: - 10.0.0.0/8 (RFC 1918) - 100.64.0.0/10 (RFC 6598) - 172.16.0.0/12 (RFC 1918) - 192.168.0.0/16 (RFC 1918) - The subnets of the VPC for the target group These supported CIDR blocks enable you to register the following with a target group: ClassicLink instances, instances in a VPC that is peered to the  load balancer VPC, AWS resources that are addressa ble by IP address and port (for example, databases), an d on-premises resources linked to AWS through AWS Direct Connect or a VPN connection. Take note that you can not specify publicly routabl e IP addresses. If you specify targets using an ins tance ID, traffic is routed to instances using the primar y private IP address specified in the primary netwo rk interface for the instance. If you specify targets using IP addresses, you can route traffic to an ins tance using any private IP address from one or more netwo rk interfaces. This enables multiple applications o n an instance to use the same port. Each network interfa ce can have its own security group. .  125 of 128 Exam AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Hence, the correct answers are the following option s: - Use an Application Elastic Load balancer with Wei ghted Target Groups to divert and proportion the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application.

The option that says: Use a Network Load balancer w ith Weighted Target Groups to divert the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application.  Divert 50% of the traffic to the new application in AWS and the other 50% to the applica tion hosted in their on-premises infrastructure is incorrect because a Network Load balancer doesn' t have Weighted Target Groups to divert the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application. The option that says: Use Route 53 with Failover ro uting policy to divert and proportion the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted application.  Divert 50% of the traffic to the new application in AWS and the other 50% to the applica tion hosted in their on-premises infrastructure is incorrect because you cannot divert and proporti on the traffic between the on-premises and AWS-host ed application using Route 53 with Failover routing po licy. This is primarily used if you want to configu re active-passive failover to your application archite cture. The option that says: Use AWS Global Accelerator to  divert and proportion the HTTP and HTTPS traffic between the on-premises and AWS-hosted appl ication. Ensure that the on-premises network has an AnyCast static IP address and is connected t o your VPC via a Direct Connect Gateway is Certkingdom incorrect because although you can control the prop ortion of traffic directed to each endpoint using A WS Global Accelerator by assigning weights across the endpoints, it is still wrong to use a Direct Connec t Gateway and an AnyCast IP address since these are n ot required at all. You can only associate static I P addresses provided by AWS Global Accelerator to reg ional AWS resources or endpoints, such as Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers, EC2 Ins tances, and Elastic IP addresses. Take note that a Direct Connect Gateway, per se, doesn't establish a  connection from your on-premises network to your Amazon VPCs.

Using Amazon EC2 eliminat es your need to invest in hardware up front, so you can develop and deploy applications faster. You  can use Amazon EC2 to launch as many or as few virtual servers as you need, configure security and  networking, and manage storage. Amazon EC2 enables you to scale up or down to handle changes in requir ements or spikes in popularity, reducing your need to forecast traffic. 2 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam In this scenario, you should deploy all the EC2 ins tances in the same Availability Zone. If you recall , data transferred between Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift, Amazon ElastiCache instances, and Elastic Network Interfaces in the same Availability  Zone is free.

You can also choose the geographical Region where Amazo n S3 will store the bucket and its contents and vie w access logs for the bucket and its objects. 5 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam By default, an S3 object is owned by the AWS accoun t that uploaded it even though the bucket is owned by another account. To get full access to the object, the object owner must explicitly grant the bucket o wner access. You can create a bucket policy to require e xternal users to grant bucket-owner-full-control wh en uploading objects so the bucket owner can have full  access to the objects. Hence, the correct answer is: Create a bucket polic y that will require the users to set the object's A CL to bucket-owner-full-control. The option that says: Enable the Requester Pays fea ture in the Amazon S3 bucket is incorrect because this option won't grant the bucket owner full acces s to the uploaded objects in the S3 bucket. With Requester Pays buckets, the requester, instead of t he bucket owner, pays the cost of the request and t he data download from the bucket. The option that says: Create a CORS configuration i n the S3 bucket is incorrect because this option on ly allows cross-origin access to your Amazon S3 resour ces. If you need to grant the bucket owner full con trol in the uploaded objects, you must create a bucket p olicy and require external users to grant bucket-ow ner- full-control when uploading objects. The option that says: Enable server access logging and set up an IAM policy that will require the user s to set the bucket's ACL to bucket-owner-full-contro l is incorrect because this option only provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. In addition, the bucket-owner-full-contro l canned ACL must be associated with the bucket polic y and not to an IAM policy. This will require the users to set the object's ACL (not the bucket's) to  bucket-owner-full-control.

        ],
        "correct": "C. C. Increase the number of shards of the Kinesis s tream by using the UpdateShardCount",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Kinesis Data Streams supports resharding, wh ich lets you adjust the number of shards in your stream to adapt to changes in the rate of data flow  through the stream. Resharding is considered an advanced operation. There are two types of resharding operations: shard  split and shard merge. In a shard split, you divid e a single shard into two shards. In a shard merge, you  combine two shards into a single shard. Resharding  is always pairwise in the sense that you cannot split into more than two shards in a single operation, an d you cannot merge more than two shards in a single opera tion. The shard or pair of shards that the reshardi ng operation acts on are referred to as parent shards.  The shard or pair of shards that result from the r esharding operation are referred to as child shards. 7 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Splitting increases the number of shards in your st ream and therefore increases the data capacity of t he stream. Because you are charged on a per-shard basi s, splitting increases the cost of your stream. Sim ilarly, merging reduces the number of shards in your stream  and therefore decreases the data capacity--and cost--of the stream. If your data rate increases, you can also increase the number of shards allocated to your stream to ma intain the application performance. You can reshard your s tream using the UpdateShardCount API. The throughput of an Amazon Kinesis data stream is desi gned to scale without limits via increasing the num ber of shards within a data stream. Hence, the correct answer is to increase the number of shards of the Kinesis stream by using the UpdateShardCount comman d. Replacing the data stream with Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose instead is incorrect because the throughput of Kinesis Firehose is not exceptionally  higher than Kinesis Data Streams. In fact, the throughput of an Amazon Kinesis data stream is desi gned to scale without limits via increasing the num ber of shards within a data stream. Improving the performance of the stream by decreasi ng the number of its shards using the MergeShard command is incorrect because merging the  shards will effectively decrease the performance of the stream rather than improve it. Implementing Step Scaling to the Kinesis Data Strea m is incorrect because there is no Step Scaling feature for Kinesis Data Streams. This is only appl icable for EC2.

        "correct": "A. A. Use path conditions to define rules that forwa rd requests to different target groups based on",
        "explanation": "Explanation If your application is composed of several individu al services, an Application Load Balancer can route  a request to a service based on the content of the re quest such as Host field, Path URL, HTTP header, HT TP method, Query string, or Source IP address. Path-ba sed routing allows you to route a client request ba sed on the URL path of the HTTP header. Each path condi tion has one path pattern. If the URL in a request matches the path pattern in a listener rule exactly , the request is routed using that rule. 9 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam A path pattern is case-sensitive, can be up to 128 characters in length, and can contain any of the fo llowing characters.

This type of routing is the most appropriate 10 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam solution for this scenario hence, the correct answe r is: Use path conditions to define rules that forw ard requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request. The option that says: Use host conditions to define  rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the hostname in the host header. Th is enables you to support multiple domains using a single load balancer is incorrect because h ost-based routing defines rules that forward reques ts to different target groups based on the hostname in th e host header instead of the URL, which is what is needed in this scenario. The option that says: Replace your ALB with a Gatew ay Load Balancer then use path conditions to define rules that forward requests to different tar get groups based on the URL in the request is incorrect because a Gateway Load Balancer does not support path-based routing. You must use an Application Load Balancer. The option that says: Replace your ALB with a Netwo rk Load Balancer then use host conditions to define rules that forward requests to different tar get groups based on the URL in the request is incorrect because a Network Load Balancer is used f or applications that need extreme network performance and static IP. It also does not support  path-based routing which is what is needed in this scenario. Furthermore, the statement mentions host- based routing even though the scenario is about pat h- based routing.

        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon S3 File Gateway presents a file interface th at enables you to store files as objects in Amazon S3 using the industry-standard NFS and SMB file protoc ols, and access those files via NFS and SMB from your data center or Amazon EC2, or access those fil es as objects directly in Amazon S3. 14 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam When you deploy File Gateway, you specify how much disk space you want to allocate for local cache. This local cache acts as a buffer for writes and pr ovides low latency access to data that was recently  written to or read from Amazon S3. When a client writes dat a to a file via File Gateway, that data is first wr itten to the local cache disk on the gateway itself. Once th e data has been safely persisted to the local cache , only then does the File Gateway acknowledge the write ba ck to the client. From there, File Gateway transfer s the data to the S3 bucket asynchronously in the bac kground, optimizing data transfer using multipart parallel uploads, and encrypting data in transit us ing HTTPS. In this scenario, you can deploy an AWS Storage Fil e Gateway to the on-premises client. After activati ng the File Gateway, create an SMB share and mount it as a local disk at the on-premises end. Copy the backups to the SMB share. You must ensure that you size the File Gateway's local cache appropriately t o the backup data that needs immediate access. After the backup is done, you will be able to access the older data but with a delay. There will be a small delay since data (not in cache) needs to be retrieved fro m Amazon S3. Hence, the correct answer is: Use an AWS Storage Fi le gateway with enough storage to keep data from the last 48 hours. Send the backups to an SMB share  mounted as a local disk. The option that says: Create an SMB file share in A mazon FSx for Windows File Server that has enough storage to store all backups.

        "explanation": "Explanation A Lambda function consists of code and any associat ed dependencies. In addition, a Lambda function als o has configuration information associated with it. I nitially, you specify the configuration information  when you create a Lambda function. Lambda provides an AP I for you to update some of the configuration data. 16 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam You pay for the AWS resources that are used to run your Lambda function. To prevent your Lambda function from running indefinitely, you specify a t imeout. When the specified timeout is reached, AWS Lambda terminates execution of your Lambda function . It is recommended that you set this value based o n your expected execution time. The default timeout i s 3 seconds and the maximum execution duration per request in AWS Lambda is 900 seconds, which is equi valent to 15 minutes. Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: The failed Lambda functions have been running for over 15 minutes and reached the maximum execution t ime. Take note that you can invoke a Lambda function syn chronously either by calling the Invoke operation o r by using an AWS SDK in your preferred runtime. If y ou anticipate a long-running Lambda function, your client may time out before function execution compl etes. To avoid this, update the client timeout or y our SDK configuration. The option that says: The concurrent execution limi t has been reached is incorrect because, by default , the AWS Lambda limits the total concurrent executio ns across all functions within a given region to 10 00. By setting a concurrency limit on a function, Lambd a guarantees that allocation will be applied specif ically to that function, regardless of the amount of traff ic processing the remaining functions. If that limi t is exceeded, the function will be throttled but not te rminated, which is in contrast with what is happeni ng in the scenario. 17 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam The option that says: The Lambda function contains a recursive code and has been running for over 15 minutes is incorrect because having a recursive code in your Lambda function does not directly resu lt to an abrupt termination of the function execution. Th is is a scenario wherein the function automatically  calls itself until some arbitrary criteria is met. This c ould lead to an unintended volume of function invoc ations and escalated costs, but not an abrupt termination because Lambda will throttle all invocations to the function. The option that says: The failed Lambda Invocations  contain a ServiceException error which means that the AWS Lambda service encountered an internal  error is incorrect because although this is a valid root cause, it is unlikely to have several Se rviceException errors throughout the day unless the re is an outage or disruption in AWS. Since the scenario says that the Lambda function runs for about 10 to 15 minutes, the maximum execution duration is the most  likely cause of the issue and not the AWS Lambda service encountering an internal error.

This gives you the ability to create and m anage Capacity Reservations independently from the billin g discounts offered by Savings Plans or Regional Reserved Instances. By creating Capacity Reservations, you ensure that you always have access to EC2 capacity when you nee d it, for as long as you need it. You can create Capa city Reservations at any time, without entering int o a one- year or three-year term commitment, and the capacit y is available immediately. Billing starts as soon as the capacity is provisioned and the Capacity Reservatio n enters the active state. When you no longer need it, cancel the Capacity Reservation to stop incurring c harges. When you create a Capacity Reservation, you specify : - The Availability Zone in which to reserve the cap acity - The number of instances for which to reserve capa city - The instance attributes, including the instance t ype, tenancy, and platform/OS Capacity Reservations can only be used by instances  that match their attributes. By default, they are automatically used by running instances that match the attributes. If you don't have any running insta nces that match the attributes of the Capacity Reservati on, it remains unused until you launch an instance with matching attributes. In addition, you can use Savings Plans and Regional  Reserved Instances with your Capacity Reservationsto benefit from billing discounts. AWS automaticall y applies your discount when the attributes of a Capacity Reservation match the attributes of a Savi ngs Plan or Regional Reserved Instance. Hence, the correct answer is to use On-Demand Capac ity Reservations, which provide compute capacity that is always available on the specified recurring schedule. Using On-Demand EC2 instances which allows you to p ay for the instances that you launch and use by the second. Reserve compute capacity in a specif ic Availability Zone to avoid any interruption is 21 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam incorrect because although an On-Demand instance is  stable and suitable for processing critical data, it costs more than any other option. Moreover, the cri tical financial calculations are only done every ni ght from 10 PM to 3 AM only and not 24/7. This means th at your compute capacity will not be utilized for a total of 19 hours every single day. On-Demand insta nces cannot reserve compute capacity at all. So thi s option is incorrect. Using Regional Reserved Instances to reserve capaci ty on a specific Availability Zone and lower down the operating cost through its billing discoun ts is incorrect because this feature is available i n Zonal Reserved Instances only and not on Regional R eserved Instances. Using Dedicated Hosts which provide a physical host  that is fully dedicated to running your instances, and bringing your existing per-socket, per-core, or  per-VM software licenses to reduce costs is incorrect because the use of a fully dedicated phys ical host is not warranted in this scenario. Moreov er, this will be underutilized since you only run the proces s for 5 hours (from 10 PM to 3 AM only), wasting 19 hours of compute capacity every single day.

        "explanation": "Explanation 24 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam A security group acts as a virtual firewall for you r instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.  When you launch an instance in a VPC, you can assign up to five security groups to the instance. Security g roups act at the instance level, not the subnet level. Th erefore, each instance in a subnet in your VPC coul d be assigned to a different set of security groups. If you don't specify a particular group at launch time , the instance is automatically assigned to the default s ecurity group for the VPC. For each security group, you add rules that control  the inbound traffic to instances, and a separate s et of rules that control the outbound traffic. This secti on describes the basic things you need to know abou t security groups for your VPC and their rules. You can add or remove rules for a security group wh ich is also referred to as authorizing or revoking inbound or outbound access. A rule applies either t o inbound traffic (ingress) or outbound traffic (eg ress). You can grant access to a specific CIDR range, or t o another security group in your VPC or in a peer V PC (requires a VPC peering connection). 25 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam In the scenario, the servers of the application-tie r are in an Auto Scaling group which means that the number of EC2 instances could grow or shrink over t ime. An Auto Scaling group could also cover one or more Availability Zones (AZ) which have their own s ubnets. Hence, the most suitable solution would be to set up the security group of the database tier to a llow database traffic from the security group of th e application servers since you can utilize the secur ity group of the application-tier Auto Scaling grou p as the source for the security group rule in your data base tier. Setting up the security group of the database tier to allow database traffic from a specified list of application server IP addresses is incorrect becaus e the list of application server IP addresses will change over time since an Auto Scaling group can add or re move EC2 instances based on the configured scaling policy. This will create inconsistencies in your ap plication because the newly launched instances, whi ch are not included in the initial list of IP addresses, w ill not be able to access the database. Setting up the Network ACL of the database subnet t o deny all inbound non-database traffic from the subnet of the application-tier is incorrect bec ause doing this could affect the other EC2 instance s of other applications, which are also hosted in the sa me subnet of the application-tier. For example, a l arge subnet with a CIDR block of /16 could be shared by several applications. Denying all inbound non- database traffic from the entire subnet will impact  other applications which use this subnet. Setting up the Network ACL of the database subnet t o allow inbound database traffic from the subnet of the application-tier is incorrect because  although this solution can work, the subnet of the application-tier could be shared by another tier or  another set of EC2 instances other than the applic ation- tier. This means that you would inadvertently be gr anting database access to unauthorized servers host ed in the same subnet other than the application-tier.

Amazon CloudFront is a service that speeds up the d istribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locat ions. When a user requests content that you're serv ing with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge loc ation that provides the lowest latency (time delay) , so that content is delivered with the best possible pe rformance. You can also set up CloudFront with origin failover  for scenarios that require high availability. An o rigin group may contain two origins: a primary and a seco ndary. If the primary origin is unavailable or retu rns 27 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam specific HTTP response status codes that indicate a  failure, CloudFront automatically switches to the secondary origin. To set up origin failover, you mu st have a distribution with at least two origins. The scenario uses an EC2 instance as an origin. Tak e note that we can also use an EC2 instance or a cu stom origin in configuring CloudFront. To achieve high a vailability in an EC2 instance, we need to deploy t he instances in two or more Availability Zones. You al so need to configure the instances to be part of th e origin group to ensure that the application is high ly available. Hence, the correct answer is: Provision two EC2 ins tances deployed in different Availability Zones and configure them to be part of an origin group. The option that says: Use Amazon S3 to serve the dy namic content of your web application and configure the S3 bucket to be part of an origin gro up is incorrect because Amazon S3 can only serve static content. If you need to host dynamic content , you have to use an Amazon EC2 instance instead. The option that says: Launch an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and configure it to be part of an origin group is incorrect because you must have at least two origins to set up an origin failover in CloudFront. In addition, you can't directly use a s ingle Auto Scaling group as an origin. The option that says: Use Lambda@Edge to improve th e performance of your web application and ensure high availability. Set the Lambda@Edge funct ions to be part of an origin group is incorrect because Lambda@Edge is primarily used for serverles s edge computing.

AWS a nd AISPL accounts can't be consolidated together. The combined use of IAM and Consolidated Billing wi ll support the autonomy of each corporate division while enabling corporate IT to maintain governance and cost oversight. Hence, the correct choices are: - Enable IAM cross-account access for all corporate  IT administrators in each child account - Use AWS Consolidated Billing by creating AWS Orga nizations to link the divisions' accounts to a parent corporate account Using AWS Trusted Advisor and AWS Resource Groups T ag Editor is incorrect.

Launch an AWS Transit Gateway with equal-cost multipath routing ( ECMP) and VPN tunnels for intra-VPC communication is incorrect because creating separat e VPCs would not separate the divisions from each other since they will still be operating under the same account and therefore contribute to the same b illing each month. AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and o n-premises networks through a central hub and acts as a cloud router where each new connection is  only made once.

        "correct": "C. Elastic Load Balancing, Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ,  and Amazon S3",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon RDS is a suitable database service for onlin e transaction processing (OLTP) applications. However, the question asks for a list of AWS servic es for the web tier and not the database tier. Also , when it comes to services providing scalability and elas ticity for your web tier, you should always conside r using Auto Scaling and Elastic Load Balancer. To build an elastic and a highly-available web tier , you can use Amazon EC2, Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancing. You can deploy your web servers on a fleet of EC2 instances to an Auto Scaling group, which will automatically monitor your applications and automatically adjust capacity to maintain stead y, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost . Load balancing is an effective way to increase th e availability of a system. Instances that fail can b e replaced seamlessly behind the load balancer whil e other instances continue to operate. Elastic Load Balanci ng can be used to balance across instances in multi ple availability zones of a region. The rest of the options are all incorrect since the y don't mention all of the required services in bui lding a highly available and scalable web tier, such as EC2 , Auto Scaling, and Elastic Load Balancer. AlthoughAmazon RDS with Multi-AZ and DynamoDB are highly sc alable databases, the scenario is more focused on building its web tier and not the database tier. Hence, the correct answer is Elastic Load Balancing , Amazon EC2, and Auto Scaling. The option that says: Elastic Load Balancing, Amazo n RDS with Multi-AZ, and Amazon S3 is incorrect because you can't host your web tier using Amazon S 3 since the application is doing a dynamic transact ions. Amazon S3 is only suitable if you plan to have a st atic website. The option that says: Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ and Auto Scaling is incorrect because the focus of the question is building a scalable web tier. You need a service, like EC2, in which you can run your web tier. The option that says: Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB, and Amazon S3 is incorrect because you need Auto Scaling and ELB in order to scale the web tier .

        ],
        "correct": "A. A. Use AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.",
        "explanation": "Explanation With AWS Lambda, you pay only for what you use. You  are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the duration, the time it takes for your code to execute. Lambda counts a request each time it starts executi ng in response to an event notification or invoke c all, including test invokes from the console. You are ch arged for the total number of requests across all y our functions. Duration is calculated from the time your code begi ns executing until it returns or otherwise terminat es, rounded up to the nearest 1ms. The price depends on  the amount of memory you allocate to your function . The Lambda free tier includes 1M free requests per month and over 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month. 43 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam The best possible answer here is to use a combinati on of AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway because this solution is both scalable and cost-effective. You will only be charged when you use your Lambda function, unlike having an EC2 instance that always  runs even though you don't use it. Hence, the correct answer is: Use AWS Lambda and Am azon API Gateway. Setting up a micro-service architecture with ECS, E CR, and Fargate is incorrect because ECS is mainly used to host Docker applications, and in add ition, using ECS, ECR, and Fargate alone is not scalable and not recommended for this type of scena rio. Hosting the APIs in a static S3 web hosting bucket behind a CloudFront web distribution is not a suitable option as there is no compute capability f or S3 and you can only use it as a static website. Although this solution is scalable since uses Cloud Front, the use of S3 to host the web APIs or the dy namic website is still incorrect. The option that says: Use a Spot Fleet of Amazon EC 2 instances, each with an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) for more consistent latency and higher networ k throughput. Set up an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to the instances is incorrect. EC2 alone, without Auto Scaling, is not scalable. Even though you use Spot EC2 instance, it  is still more expensive compared to Lambda because you will be charged only when your function is bein g used. An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is simply a network device that you can attach to your Amazon E C2 instance that enables you to achieve the application performance of an on-premises HPC clust er, with scalability, flexibility, and elasticity p rovided 44 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam by the AWS Cloud.

        "correct": "B. B. Use Amazon S3 Multipart Upload API.",
        "explanation": "Explanation The main issue is the slow upload time of the video  objects to Amazon S3. To address this issue, you c an use Multipart upload in S3 to improve the throughpu t. It allows you to upload parts of your object in parallel thus, decreasing the time it takes to uplo ad big objects. Each part is a contiguous portion o f the object's data. 45 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam You can upload these object parts independently and  in any order. If transmission of any part fails, y ou can retransmit that part without affecting other parts.  After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazo n S3 assembles these parts and creates the object. In ge neral, when your object size reaches 100 MB, you sh ould consider using multipart uploads instead of uploadi ng the object in a single operation. Using multipart upload provides the following advan tages: Improved throughput - You can upload parts in paral lel to improve throughput. Quick recovery from any network issues - Smaller pa rt size minimizes the impact of restarting a failed upload due to a network error. Pause and resume object uploads - You can upload ob ject parts over time. Once you initiate a multipart upload, there is no expiry; you must explicitly com plete or abort the multipart upload. Begin an upload before you know the final object si ze - You can upload an object as you are creating i t. Enabling Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Netwo rk Adapter (ENA) on your EC2 Instances is incorrect. Even though this will improve network pe rformance, the issue will still persist since the p roblem lies in the upload time of the object to Amazon S3.  You should use the Multipart upload feature instea d. Leveraging on Amazon CloudFront and using HTTP POST  method to reduce latency is incorrect because CloudFront is a CDN service and is not used  to expedite the upload process of objects to Amazo n 46 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam S3.

        "explanation": "Explanation The best option is to create a role in IAM. Afterwa rd, assign this role to a new EC2 instance. Applica tions must sign their API requests with AWS credentials. Therefore, if you are an application developer, you need a strategy for managing credentials for your a pplications that run on EC2 instances. 47 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam You can securely distribute your AWS credentials to  the instances, enabling the applications on those instances to use your credentials to sign requests while protecting your credentials from other users. However, it's challenging to securely distribute cr edentials to each instance, especially those that A WS creates on your behalf such as Spot Instances or instances in Auto Scaling  groups. You must also be able to update the creden tials on each instance when you rotate your AWS credentia ls. In this scenario, you have to use IAM roles so that  your applications can securely make API requests f rom your instances without requiring you to manage the security credentials that the applications use. Ins tead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials, you  can delegate permission to make API requests using IAM roles. Hence, the correct answer is: Create a role in IAM.

        "explanation": "Explanation If your application is hosted in multiple AWS Regio ns, you can improve performance for your users by serving their requests from the AWS Region that pro vides the lowest latency. You can create latency records for your resources i n multiple AWS Regions by using latency-based routi ng. In the event that Route 53 receives a DNS query for  your domain or subdomain such as tutorialsdojo.com or portal.tutorialsdojo.com, it determines which AW S Regions you've created latency records for, determines which region gives the user the lowest l atency and then selects a latency record for that r egion. Route 53 responds with the value from the selected record which can be the IP address for a web server  or the CNAME of your elastic load balancer. Hence, using Route 53 to distribute the load to the  multiple EC2 instances across all AWS Regions is the correct answer. 49 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Using a Network Load Balancer to distribute the loa d to the multiple EC2 instances across all AWS Regions and using an Application Load Balancer to d istribute the load to the multiple EC2 instances across all AWS Regions are both incorrect because l oad balancers distribute traffic only within their respective regions and not to other AWS regions by default. Although Network Load Balancers support connections from clients to IP-based targets in pee red VPCs across different AWS Regions, the scenario didn't mention that the VPCs are peered with each o ther. It is best to use Route 53 instead to balance  the incoming load to two or more AWS regions more effec tively.

When cross-zo ne load balancing is enabled, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets i n all enabled Availability Zones. When cross-zone load ba lancing is disabled, each load balancer node distributes traffic only across the registered targ ets in its Availability Zone. The following diagrams demonstrate the effect of cr oss-zone load balancing. There are two enabled Availability Zones, with two targets in Availabilit y Zone A and eight targets in Availability Zone B. Clients send requests, and Amazon Route 53 responds  to each request with the IP address of one of the load balancer nodes. This distributes traffic such that each load balancer node receives 50% of the traffic  from the clients. Each load balancer node distributes it s share of the traffic across the registered target s in its scope. If cross-zone load balancing is enabled, each of th e 10 targets receives 10% of the traffic. This is b ecause each load balancer node can route 50% of the client  traffic to all 10 targets. 52 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam If cross-zone load balancing is disabled: Each of the two targets in Availability Zone A rece ives 25% of the traffic.

With Network Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balanc ers, cross-zone load balancing is disabled by default. After you create the load balancer, you ca n enable or disable cross-zone load balancing at an y time. When you create a Classic Load Balancer, the defaul t for cross-zone load balancing depends on how you create the load balancer. With the API or CLI, cros s-zone load balancing is disabled by default. With the AWS Management Console, the option to enable cross- zone load balancing is selected by default. After you create a Classic Load Balancer, you can enable or disable cross-zone load balancing at any time Hence, the right answer is to enable cross-zone loa d balancing. Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM) is incorrect b ecause this is merely a feature in Amazon VPC that provides network administrators with an automa ted IP management workflow.

Path-based Routing is incorrect because this featur e is based on the paths that are in the URL of the request. It automatically routes traffic to a parti cular target group based on the request URL.

You ca n store anything from code to binaries and work seamlessly with your existing Git- based tools. CodeCommit integrates with CodePipelin e and CodeDeploy to streamline your development and release process. You could also use OpsWorks to deploy your code, ho wever, creating OpsWorks recipes that will automatically launch resources containing the lates t version of the code is still incorrect because yo u don't need to launch new resources containing your new code when you can just update the ones that are already running.

        "correct": "A. A. Use versioned objects",
        "explanation": "Explanation To control the versions of files that are served fr om your distribution, you can either invalidate fil es or give them versioned file names. If you want to update yo ur files frequently, AWS recommends that you primarily use file versioning for the following rea sons: 59 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam - Versioning enables you to control which file a re quest returns even when the user has a version cach ed either locally or behind a corporate caching proxy.  If you invalidate the file, the user might continu e to see the old version until it expires from those caches. - CloudFront access logs include the names of your files, so versioning makes it easier to analyze the results of file changes. - Versioning provides a way to serve different vers ions of files to different users. - Versioning simplifies rolling forward and back be tween file revisions. - Versioning is less expensive. You still have to p ay for CloudFront to transfer new versions of your files to edge locations, but you don't have to pay for inval idating files. Invalidating the files in your CloudFront web distr ibution is incorrect because even though using invalidation will solve this issue, this solution i s more expensive as compared to using versioned obj ects. Adding a separate cache behavior path for the conte nt and configuring a custom object caching with a Minimum TTL of 0 is incorrect because this alone is not enough to solve the problem. A cache behavio r is primarily used to configure a variety of CloudFr ont functionality for a given URL path pattern for files on your website. Although this solution may work, i t is still better to use versioned objects where yo u can control which image will be returned by the system even when the user has another version cached eithe r locally or behind a corporate caching proxy. Adding Cache-Control no-cache, no-store, or private  directives in the S3 bucket is incorrect because although it is right to configure your origin to ad d the Cache-Control or Expires header field, you sh ould do this to your objects and not on the entire S3 bu cket.

        "correct": "B. B. Migrate the existing database to Amazon Aurora  and create a cross-region read replica.",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Aurora is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud, that combines the performance and availability of tradit ional enterprise databases with the simplicity and cost- effectiveness of open source databases. Amazon Auro ra is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases and three times faster than standard Post greSQL databases. It provides the security, availability, and reliabi lity of commercial databases at 1/10th the cost. Am azon Aurora is fully managed by Amazon RDS, which automa tes time-consuming administration tasks like hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, an d backups. Based on the given scenario, there is a significant  slowdown after testing the read performance from t he secondary AWS Region. Since the existing setup is a n Amazon RDS for MySQL, you should migrate the database to Amazon Aurora and create a cross-region  read replica. 61 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam The read replication latency of less than 1 second is only possible if you would use Amazon Aurora replicas. Aurora replicas are independent endpoints  in an Aurora DB cluster, best used for scaling rea d operations and increasing availability. You can cre ate up to 15 replicas within an AWS Region. Hence, the correct answer is: Migrate the existing database to Amazon Aurora and create a cross- region read replica. The option that says: Upgrade the MySQL database en gine is incorrect because upgrading the database engine wouldn't improve the read replication latenc y to milliseconds. To achieve the read replication latency of less than 1-second requirement, you need  to use Amazon Aurora replicas. The option that says: Use Amazon ElastiCache to imp rove database performance is incorrect. Amazon ElastiCache won't be able to improve the database p erformance because it is experiencing highly dynami c reads. This option would be helpful if the database  frequently receives the same queries. The option that says: Create an Amazon RDS for MySQ L read replica in the secondary AWS Region is incorrect because MySQL replicas won't provide y ou a read replication latency of less than 1 second .

        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-s cale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2's simple web service interface allows you to ob tain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computin g resources and lets you run on Amazon's proven computing environment. The first requirement as per the scenario is to dec ommission and shut down several EC2 Reserved Instances. However, it is also mentioned that the a udit team still requires the data for compliance pu rposes. 64 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam To fulfill the given requirements, you can first cr eate a snapshot of the instance to save its data an d then sell the instance to the Reserved Instance Marketplace. The Reserved Instance Marketplace is a platform tha t supports the sale of third-party and AWS customer s' unused Standard Reserved Instances, which vary in t erms of length and pricing options. For example, yo u may want to sell Reserved Instances after moving in stances to a new AWS region, changing to a new instance type, ending projects before the term expi ration, when your business needs change, or if you have unneeded capacity. Hence, the correct answers are: - You can opt to sell these EC2 instances on the AW S Reserved Instance Marketplace. - Take snapshots of the EBS volumes and terminate t he EC2 instances. The option that says: Convert the EC2 instance to O n-Demand instances is incorrect because it's stated in the scenario that the development team no longer  needs several EC2 Reserved Instances. By convertin g it to On-Demand instances, the company will still h ave instances running in their infrastructure and t his will result in additional costs. The option that says: Convert the EC2 instances to Spot instances with a persistent Spot request type is incorrect because the requirement in the scenari o is to terminate or shut down several EC2 Reserved Instances.

In MySQ L Read Replicas, data from your primary instance is replayed on your replica as transactions. For most use cases, including read scaling and high availabi lity, it is recommended using Amazon Aurora Replicas. 66 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Read Replicas are primarily used for improving the read performance of the application. The most suita ble solution in this scenario is to use Multi-AZ deploy ments instead but since this option is not availabl e, you can still set up Read Replicas which you can promot e as your primary stand-alone DB cluster in the eve nt of an outage.

        "correct": "D. D. The Cache-Control max-age directive is set to zero.",
        "explanation": "Explanation You can control how long your objects stay in a Clo udFront cache before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin. Reducing the duration allow s you to serve dynamic content. Increasing the dura tion means your users get better performance because you r objects are more likely to be served directly fro m the edge cache. A longer duration also reduces the load  on your origin. Typically, CloudFront serves an object from an edge  location until the cache duration that you specifi ed passes -- that is, until the object expires. After it expires, the next time the edge location gets a user request for the object, CloudFront forwards the request to the origin server to verify that the cache contains  the latest version of the object. 68 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam The Cache-Control and Expires headers control how l ong objects stay in the cache. The Cache-Control max-age directive lets you specify how long (in sec onds) you want an object to remain in the cache bef ore CloudFront gets the object again from the origin server. The m inimum expiration time CloudFront supports is 0 seconds for web distributions and 3600 seconds for RTMP distributions. In this scenario, the main culprit is that the Cach e-Control max-age directive is set to a low value, which is why the request is always directed to your origin s erver. Hence, the correct answer is: The Cache-Control max -age directive is set to zero. The option that says: An object is only cached by C loudFront once a successful request has been made hence, the objects were not requested before, which  is why the request is still directed to the origin server is incorrect because the issue also occurs e ven for the commonly requested objects. This means that these objects were successfully requested before bu t due to a zero Cache-Control max-age directive val ue, it causes this issue in CloudFront. 69 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam The option that says: The file sizes of the cached objects are too large for CloudFront to handle is incorrect because this is not related to the issue in caching.

An origin grou p includes two origins which are the primary origin a nd the second origin that will be used for the actu al failover. It also includes the failover criteria th at you need to specify.

        "correct": "B. B. Launch an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon E FS) with Provisioned Throughput mode",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides si mple, scalable file storage for use with your Amazon ECS tasks. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity  is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files. Your applications can hav e the storage they need when they need it. You can use Amazon EFS file systems with Amazon ECS  to access file system data across your fleet of Amazon ECS tasks. That way, your tasks have access to the same persistent storage, no matter the infrastructure or container instance on which they land. When you reference your Amazon EFS file syste m and container mount point in your Amazon ECS task d efinition, Amazon ECS takes care of mounting the file system in your container. 72 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam To support a wide variety of cloud storage workload s, Amazon EFS offers two performance modes: - General Purpose mode - Max I/O mode. You choose a file system's performance mode when yo u create it, and it cannot be changed. The two performance modes have no additional costs, so your  Amazon EFS file system is billed and metered the same, regardless of your performance mode. There are two throughput modes to choose from for y our file system: - Bursting Throughput 73 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam - Provisioned Throughput With Bursting Throughput mode, a file system's thro ughput scales as the amount of data stored in the E FS Standard or One Zone storage class grows. File-base d workloads are typically spiky, driving high level s of throughput for short periods of time, and low level s of throughput the rest of the time. To accommodat e this, Amazon EFS is designed to burst to high throu ghput levels for periods of time. Provisioned Throughput mode is available for applic ations with high throughput to storage (MiB/s per T iB) ratios, or with requirements greater than those all owed by the Bursting Throughput mode. For example, say you're using Amazon EFS for development tools, web serving, or content management applications where the amount of data in your file system is low relat ive to throughput demands. Your file system can now  get the high levels of throughput your applications req uire without having to pad your file system. In the scenario, the file system will be frequently  accessed by users around the globe so it is expect ed that there would be hundreds of ECS tasks running most o f the time. The Architect must ensure that its stor age system is optimized for high-frequency read and wri te operations. Hence, the correct answer is: Launch an Amazon Elas tic File System (Amazon EFS) with Provisioned Throughput mode and set the performance mode to Max  I/O. Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of  the Amazon ECS cluster. The option that says: Set up an SMB file share by c reating an Amazon FSx File Gateway in Storage Gateway. Set the file share as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the Amazon ECS cluster is incorrect. Although you can use an A mazon FSx for Windows File Server in this situation , it is not appropriate to use this since the applica tion is not connected to an on-premises data center . Take note that the AWS Storage Gateway service is primar ily used to integrate your existing on-premises sto rage to AWS. The option that says: Launch an Amazon Elastic File  System (Amazon EFS) file system with Bursting Throughput mode and set the performance mode to Gen eral Purpose. Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task defini tion of the Amazon ECS cluster is incorrect because using Bursting Throughput mode won't be abl e to sustain the constant demand of the global application. Remember that the application will be frequently accessed by users around the world and t here are hundreds of ECS tasks running most of the time. The option that says: Launch an Amazon DynamoDB tab le with Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and DynamoDB Streams enabled. Configure the t able to be accessible by all Amazon ECS cluster instances. Set the DynamoDB table as the co ntainer mount point in the ECS task definition of the Amazon ECS cluster is incorrect because you can not directly set a DynamoDB table as a container mount point. In the first place, DynamoDB is a data base and not a file system which means that it can' t be \"mounted\" to a server. 74 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam References: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/develo perguide/tutorial-efs-volumes.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/performan ce.html https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/develo perguide/tutorial-wfsx-volumes.html Check out this Amazon EFS Cheat Sheet: https://tutorialsdojo.com/amazon-efs/",

T hese workloads commonly require data to be presented via a fast and scalable file system inter face, and typically have data sets stored on long-t erm data stores like Amazon S3. Operating high-performance file systems typically r equire specialized expertise and administrative overhead, requiring you to provision storage server s and tune complex performance parameters. With Amazon FSx, you can launch and run a file system th at provides sub-millisecond access to your data and allows you to read and write data at speeds of up t o hundreds of gigabytes per second of throughput an d millions of IOPS. Amazon FSx for Lustre works natively with Amazon S3 , making it easy for you to process cloud data sets with high-performance file systems. When linked to an S3 bucket, an FSx for Lustre file system transparently presents S3 objects as files and allo ws you to write results back to S3. You can also us e FSx for Lustre as a standalone high-performance file sy stem to burst your workloads from on-premises to th e cloud. By copying on-premises data to an FSx for Lu stre file system, you can make that data available for fast processing by compute instances running on AWS . With Amazon FSx, you pay for only the resources you use. There are no minimum commitments, upfront hardware or software costs, or additional fees. 77 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam For Windows-based applications, Amazon FSx provides  fully managed Windows file servers with features and performance optimized for \"lift-and-shift\" busi ness-critical application workloads including home directories (user shares), media workflows, and ERP  applications. It is accessible from Windows and Li nux instances via the SMB protocol. If you have Linux-b ased applications, Amazon EFS is a cloud-native ful ly managed file system that provides simple, scalable,  elastic file storage accessible from Linux instanc es via the NFS protocol. For compute-intensive and fast processing workloads , like high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning, EDA, and media processing, Amazon FSx for  Lustre, provides a file system that's optimized fo r performance, with input and output stored on Amazon  S3. Hence, the correct answer is: Amazon FSx for Lustre . Amazon Elastic File System (EFS) is incorrect becau se although the EFS service can be used for HPC applications, it doesn't natively work with Amazon S3. It doesn't have the capability to easily proces s your S3 data with a high-performance POSIX interface, un like Amazon FSx for Lustre. Amazon FSx for Windows File Server is incorrect bec ause although this service is a type of Amazon FSx,it does not work natively with Amazon S3. This serv ice is a fully managed native Microsoft Windows fil e system that is primarily used for your Windows-base d applications that require shared file storage to AWS. Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS) is incorrect bec ause this service is not a scalable, high-performan ce file system.

When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a pri mary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availabil ity Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engine ered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS pe rforms an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that  you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete.

A clus ter placement group can span peered VPCs in the same Re gion. Instances in the same cluster placement group enjoy a higher per-flow throughput limit for TCP/IP  traffic and are placed in the same high-bisection bandwidth segment of the network. It is recommended that you launch the number of ins tances that you need in the placement group in a si ngle launch request and that you use the same instance t ype for all instances in the placement group. If yo u try to add more instances to the placement group later, or  if you try to launch more than one instance type i n the placement group, you increase your chances of getti ng an insufficient capacity error. If you stop an i nstance 88 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam in a placement group and then start it again, it st ill runs in the placement group. However, the start  fails if there isn't enough capacity for the instance.

Stop and restart the instances in the Placement gro up and then try the launch again can resolve this i ssue. If the instances are stopped and restarted, AWS may mo ve the instances to a hardware that has the capacit y for all the requested instances. Hence, the correct answer is: Stop and restart the instances in the Placement Group and then try the launch again. The option that says: Create another Placement Grou p and launch the new instances in the new group is incorrect because to benefit from the enhanced n etworking, all the instances should be in the same Placement Group. Launching the new ones in a new Pl acement Group will not work in this case.

It provides static IP a ddresses that act as a fixed entry point to your ap plication endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such  as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, or Amazon EC2 instances. When the application usage grows, the number of IP addresses and endpoints that you need to manage als o increase. AWS Global Accelerator allows you to scal e your network up or down. AWS Global Accelerator lets you associate regional resources, such as load  balancers and EC2 instances, to two static IP addr esses. You only whitelist these addresses once in your cli ent applications, firewalls, and DNS records. certkingd certkingd certkingd With AWS Global Accelerator, you can add or remove endpoints in the AWS Regions, run blue/green deployment, and A/B test without needing to update the IP addresses in your client applications. This is particularly useful for IoT, retail, media, automot ive, and healthcare use cases in which client appli cations cannot be updated frequently. certkingd 94 of 124 certkingd AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam If you have multiple resources in multiple regions,  you can use AWS Global Accelerator to reduce the number of IP addresses. By creating an endpoint gro up, you can add all of your EC2 instances from a single region in that group. You can add additional  endpoint groups for instances in other regions. Af ter it, you can then associate the appropriate ALB endpoints to  each of your endpoint groups. The created accelerator would have two static IP addresses that  you can use to create a security rule in your fire wall device. Instead of regularly adding the Amazon EC2 IP addre sses in your firewall, you can use the static IP ad dresses of AWS Global Accelerator to automate the process a nd eliminate this repetitive task. Hence, the correct answer is: Use AWS Global Accele rator and create an endpoint group for each AWS Region. Associate the Application Load Balancer  from each region to the corresponding endpoint group. The option that says: Use AWS Global Accelerator an d create multiple endpoints for all the available AWS Regions. Associate all the private IP addresses  of the EC2 instances to the corresponding endpoints is incorrect. It is better to create one endpoint group instead of multiple endpoints. Moreo ver, you have to associate the ALBs in AWS Global Accele rator and not the underlying EC2 instances. The option that says: Create a new Lambda function that tracks the changes in the IP addresses of all ALBs across multiple AWS Regions. Schedule the func tion to run and update the corporate firewall certkingd every hour using Amazon CloudWatch Events is incorr ect because this approach entails a lot of administrative overhead and takes a significant amo unt of time to implement. Using a custom Lambda function is actually not necessary since you can si mply use AWS Global Accelerator to achieve this requirement. The option that says: Launch a Network Load Balance r with an associated Elastic IP address. Set the ALBs in multiple Regions as targets is incorrect. A lthough you can allocate an Elastic IP address to y our certkingd ELB, it is not suitable to route traffic to your AL Bs across multiple Regions. You have to use AWS Glo bal Accelerator instead.

IAM database authentication works w ith MySQL and PostgreSQL. With this authentication method, you don't need to use a password when you c onnect to a DB instance. Instead, you use an authentication token. An authentication token is a unique string of chara cters that Amazon RDS generates on request. Authentication tokens are generated using AWS Signa ture Version 4. Each token has a lifetime of 15 minutes. You don't need to store user credentials i n the database, because authentication is managed externally using IAM. You can also still use standa rd database authentication. IAM database authentication provides the following benefits: - Network traffic to and from the database is encry pted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). - You can use IAM to centrally manage access to you r database resources, instead of managing access individually on each DB instance. - For applications running on Amazon EC2, you can u se profile credentials specific to your EC2 instanc e to access your database instead of a password, for gre ater security Hence, setting up an RDS database and enable the IA M DB Authentication is the correct answer based on the above reference.

        "explanation": "Explanation You can configure your AWS account to enforce the e ncryption of the new EBS volumes and snapshot copies that you create. For example, Amazon EBS enc rypts the EBS volumes created when you launch an instance and the snapshots that you copy from an un encrypted snapshot. 108 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Encryption by default has no effect on existing EBS  volumes or snapshots. The following are important considerations in EBS encryption: - Encryption by default is a Region-specific settin g. If you enable it for a Region, you cannot disabl e it for individual volumes or snapshots in that Region. - When you enable encryption by default, you can la unch an instance only if the instance type supports EBS encryption. - Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric CMKs. When migrating servers using AWS Server Migration S ervice (SMS), do not turn on encryption by default. If encryption by default is already on and you are experiencing delta replication failures, turn off e ncryption by default. Instead, enable AMI encryption when you  create the replication job. You cannot change the CMK that is associated with a n existing snapshot or encrypted volume. However, you can associate a different CMK during a snapshot  copy operation so that the resulting copied snapsh ot is encrypted by the new CMK. 109 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Although there is no direct way to encrypt an exist ing unencrypted volume or snapshot, you can encrypt them by creating either a volume or a snapshot. If you enabled encryption by default, Amazon EBS encrypts the resulting new volume or snapshot using  your default key for EBS encryption. Even if you h ave not enabled encryption by default, you can enable encry ption when you create an individual volume or snapshot. Whether you enable encryption by default or in individual creation operations, you can overr ide the default key for EBS encryption and use symmetric cu stomer-managed CMK. Hence, the correct answer is: Enable the EBS Encryp tion By Default feature for the AWS Region. The option that says: Launch new EBS volumes and en crypt them using an asymmetric customer master key (CMK) is incorrect because Amazon EBS do es not support asymmetric CMKs. To encrypt an EBS snapshot, you need to use symmetric CMK. The option that says: Launch new EBS volumes and sp ecify the symmetric customer master key (CMK) for encryption is incorrect. Although this so lution will enable data encryption, this process is manual and can potentially cause some unencrypted E BS volumes to be launched. A better solution is to enable the EBS Encryption By Default feature. It is  stated in the scenario that all of the new EBS vol umes restored from the unencrypted snapshots must be aut omatically encrypted.

        "correct": "",
        "explanation": "Explanation You can use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt c onnections between your client applications and you r Amazon RDS DB instances running Microsoft SQL Serve r. SSL support is available in all AWS regions for all supported SQL Server editions. When you create an SQL Server DB instance, Amazon R DS creates an SSL certificate for it. The SSL certificate includes the DB instance endpoint as th e Common Name (CN) for the SSL certificate to guard against spoofing attacks. There are 2 ways to use SSL to connect to your SQL Server DB instance: - Force SSL for all connections -- this happens tra nsparently to the client, and the client doesn't ha ve to do any work to use SSL. - Encrypt specific connections -- this sets up an S SL connection from a specific client computer, and you must do work on the client to encrypt connections. You can force all connections to your DB instance t o use SSL, or you can encrypt connections from specific client computers only. To use SSL from a s pecific client, you must obtain certificates for th e client 111 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam computer, import certificates on the client compute r, and then encrypt the connections from the client computer. If you want to force SSL, use the rds.force_ssl par ameter. By default, the rds.force_ssl parameter is set to false. Set the rds.force_ssl parameter to true to f orce connections to use SSL. The rds.force_ssl para meter is static, so after you change the value, you must reb oot your DB instance for the change to take effect. Hence, the correct answers for this scenario are th e options that say: - Force all connections to your DB instance to use SSL by setting the rds.force_ssl parameter to true. Once done, reboot your DB instance. - Download the Amazon RDS Root CA certificate. Impo rt the certificate to your servers and configure your application to use SSL to encrypt th e connection to RDS. Specifying the TDE option in an RDS option group th at is associated with that DB instance to enable transparent data encryption (TDE) is incorrect beca use transparent data encryption (TDE) is primarily used to encrypt stored data on your DB instances ru nning Microsoft SQL Server, and not the data that a re in transit. Enabling the IAM DB authentication in RDS using the  AWS Management Console is incorrect because IAM database authentication is only support ed in MySQL and PostgreSQL database engines. With IAM database authentication, you don't need to use a password when you connect to a DB instance but instead, you use an authentication token. Configuring the security groups of your EC2 instanc es and RDS to only allow traffic to and from port 443 is incorrect because it is not enough to d o this. You need to either force all connections to  your DB instance to use SSL, or you can encrypt connecti ons from specific client computers, just as mention ed above.

        "correct": "D. D. Create a new IAM Role which will be assumed by  the IAM user. Attach a policy allowing",
        "explanation": "Explanation In this scenario, the best option is to use IAM Rol e to provide access. You can create a new IAM Role then associate it to the IAM user. Attach a policy allow ing access to modify the ELB and once it is done, remove the IAM role to the user. An IAM role is similar to a user in that it is an A WS identity with permission policies that determine  what the identity can and cannot do in AWS. However, ins tead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it. Al so, a role does not have standard long-term credent ials (password or access keys) associated with it. Inste ad, if a user assumes a role, temporary security credentials are created dynamically and provided to  the user. You can use roles to delegate access to users, appl ications, or services that don't normally have acce ss to your AWS resources. For example, you might want to grant users in your AWS account access to resources they don't usually have, or grant users in one AWS account access to resources in another account. Or you might want to allow a mobile app to use AWS resourc es, but not want to embed AWS keys within the app (where they can be difficult to rotate and where us ers can potentially extract them). Sometimes you wa nt to give AWS access to users who already have identitie s defined outside of AWS, such as in your corporate directory.

        "correct": "D. D. Inter-Region VPC Peering",
        "explanation": "Explanation Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) offers a comprehensive set of virtual networking capabilities that provide AWS customers with many o ptions for designing and implementing networks on the AWS cloud. With Amazon VPC, you can provision l ogically isolated virtual networks to host your AWS resources. You can create multiple VPCs within the same region or in different regions, in the sam e account or in different accounts. This is useful fo r customers who require multiple VPCs for security, billing, regulatory, or other purposes, and want to  integrate AWS resources between their VPCs more easily. More often than not, these different VPCs n eed to communicate privately and securely with one another for sharing data or applications. A VPC peering connection is a networking connection  between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic between them privately. Instances in either VPC can  communicate with each other as if they are within the same network. You can create a VPC peering connecti on between your own VPCs, with a VPC in another AWS account, or with a VPC in a different AWS Regio n. 115 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam AWS uses the existing infrastructure of a VPC to cr eate a VPC peering connection; it is neither a gate way nor a VPN connection and does not rely on a separat e piece of physical hardware. There is no single po int of failure for communication or a bandwidth bottlen eck. Hence, the correct answer is: Inter-Region VPC Peer ing. AWS Cloud Map is incorrect because this is simply a  cloud resource discovery service. With Cloud Map, you can define custom names for your application re sources, and it maintains the updated location of t hese dynamically changing resources. This increases your application  availability because your web service always disco vers the most up-to-date locations of its resources. VPN Connection is incorrect. This is technically po ssible, but since you already have 2 VPCs on AWS, i t is easier to set up a VPC peering connection. The b andwidth is also faster for VPC peering since the connection will be going through the AWS backbone n etwork instead of the public Internet when you use a VPN connection. VPC Endpoint is incorrect because this is primarily  used to allow you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services po wered by PrivateLink, but not to the other VPC itself.

        "correct": "A. A. Use AWS Organizations and Service Control Poli cies to control services on each account.",
        "explanation": "Explanation Using AWS Organizations and Service Control Policie s to control services on each account is the correct answer. Refer to the diagram below: 118 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam AWS Organizations offers policy-based management fo r multiple AWS accounts. With Organizations, you can create groups of accounts, automate account cre ation, apply and manage policies for those groups. Organizations enables you to centrally manage polic ies across multiple accounts, without requiring cus tom scripts and manual processes. It allows you to crea te Service Control Policies (SCPs) that centrally c ontrol AWS service use across multiple AWS accounts. Setting up a common IAM policy that can be applied across all AWS accounts is incorrect because it is not possible to create a common IAM policy for mult iple AWS accounts. The option that says: Connect all departments by se tting up a cross-account access to each of the AWS accounts of the company. Create and attach IAM poli cies to your resources based on their respective departments to control access is incorrect because although you can set up cross-account access to eac h department, this entails a lot of configuration com pared with using AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies (SCPs). Cross-account access would  be a more suitable choice if you only have two accounts to manage, but not for multiple accounts. The option that says: Provide access to externally authenticated users via Identity Federation. Set up an IAM role to specify permissions for users from e ach department whose identity is federated from your organization or a third-party identity provide r is incorrect as this option is focused on the Ide ntity Federation authentication set up for your AWS accou nts but not the IAM policy management for multiple AWS accounts.

        "explanation": "Explanation AWS offers two kinds of NAT devices -- a NAT gatewa y or a NAT instance. It is recommended to use NAT gateways, as they provide better availability a nd bandwidth over NAT instances. The NAT Gateway service is also a managed service that does not req uire your administration efforts. A NAT instance is launched from a NAT AMI. Just like a NAT instance, you can use a network add ress translation (NAT) gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiat ing a connection with those instances. Here is a diagram showing the differences between N AT gateway and NAT instance: 120 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam Egress-Only Internet Gateway is incorrect because t his is primarily used for VPCs that use IPv6 to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the Internet or other AWS services, but prevent the Internet from initiating a connection with those in stances, just like what NAT Instance and NAT Gatewa y do. The scenario explicitly says that the EC2 insta nces are using IPv4 addresses which is why Egress-o nly Internet gateway is invalid, even though it can pro vide the required high availability. 121 of 124 AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate ( SAA-C 02 / SAA-C03 ) Exam VPC Endpoint is incorrect because this simply enabl es you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by P rivateLink without requiring an Internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect c onnection.
