       "{'question': ': A software development company is using serverless computing with AWS Lambda to build and run applications without having to set up or manage ser vers. They have a Lambda function that connects to a MongoDB Atlas, which is a popular Database as a Ser vice (DBaaS) platform and also uses a third party API to fetch certain data for their application. On e of the developers was instructed to create the environment variables for the MongoDB database host name, username, and password as well as the API credentials that will be used by the Lambda functio n for DEV, SIT, UAT, and PROD environments. Considering that the Lambda function is storing sen sitive database and API credentials, how can this information be secured to prevent other developers in the team, or anyone, from seeing these credentia ls in plain text?

       "  'D. Create a new KMS key and use it to enable encr yption helpers that leverage on AWS Key'],\n",
       " 'correct': 'D. Create a new KMS key and use it to enable encr yption helpers that leverage on AWS Key',\n",
       " 'explanation': 'Explanation When you create or update Lambda functions that use  environment variables, AWS Lambda encrypts them using the AWS Key Management Service. When your Lam bda function is invoked, those values are decrypted and made available to the Lambda code. The first time you create or update Lambda function s that use environment variables in a region, a def ault service key is created for you automatically within  AWS KMS. This key is used to encrypt environment variables. However, if you wish to use encryption h elpers and use KMS to encrypt environment variables after your Lambda function is created, you must cre ate your own AWS KMS key and choose it instead of the default key. The default key will give errors w hen chosen. Creating your own key gives you more flexibility, including the ability to create, rotat e, disable, and define access controls, and to audi t the encryption keys used to protect your data. The option that says: There is no need to do anythi ng because, by default, AWS Lambda already encrypts the environment variables using the AWS Ke y Management Service is incorrect. Although Lambda encrypts the environment variables in your f unction by default, the sensitive information would still be visible to other users who have access to the Lambda console. This is because Lambda uses a default KMS key to encrypt the variables, which is usually accessible by other users. The best option in this scenario is to use encryption helpers to secure you r environment variables. The option that says: Enable SSL encryption that le verages on AWS CloudHSM to store and encrypt the sensitive information is also incorrect since e nabling SSL would encrypt data only when in-transit . Your other teams would still be able to view the pl aintext at-rest. Use AWS KMS instead. The option that says: AWS Lambda does not provide e ncryption for the environment variables. Deploy your code to an EC2 instance instead is inco rrect since, as mentioned, Lambda does provide encryption functionality of environment variables.
